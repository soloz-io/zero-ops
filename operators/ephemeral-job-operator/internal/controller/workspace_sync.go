	// This operator serves every fleet on the spoke, and each one keeps its S3

	// forbids, and which the preflight check rejects — and it would also be
	// simply wrong for the second fleet onboarded.
	//
	// The tenant namespace IS the fleet id (the registry renders workloads into
	// `namespace: {TENANT_ID}`), so `{namespace}-app-secrets` resolves to
	// exactly the Secret each fleet's registry already declares — for waypoint,
	// the one its own SDK binds S3_* from
	// (workloads/base/sdk/rollout-patch.yaml, rendered by the ExternalSecret in
	// values.yaml). Reusing the fleet's own Secret rather than rendering a
	// parallel platform-owned one means a credential rotation lands in one
	// place, and the sidecar and the SDK cannot disagree about which bucket a
	// workspace lives in.
	//
	// Two earlier values were wrong, and both failed SILENTLY, because every
	// reference the operator injects is optional (a cluster without Infisical
	// must still start a sandbox): the sidecar simply reported "object storage
	// not configured" and no-opped every checkpoint.

	//     (hub-operator's constant: "For CAPI/CCM/CSI"). It carries S3 keys only
	//     in waypoint's local Kind manifest; no registry binds it for an SDK, so
	//     it worked locally and in no deployed environment.
	//   - `{namespace}-app-secrets` — the THIRD wrong value, and wrong in a new
	//     way: no Secret of that name exists in any tenant namespace. The
	//     reasoning above ("the Secret each fleet's registry already declares")
	//     was simply not true of any fleet. Verified on nutgraf-01: the namespace
	//     holds no `*-app-secrets` at all.
	//
	// THE REAL SHAPE: a fleet splits these across TWO objects, and no single
	// name can satisfy the sidecar.

	// Keyed on appId, NOT namespace. After ADR-088 the namespace is
	// `tenant-<tenantId>-<appId>` while the fleet's own objects are named from the

// workspaceSyncContainers builds the restore init container and the sync
// sidecar for a persisted workspace. BOTH belong in `.spec.initContainers`.
//
// The sidecar is a NATIVE sidecar — an init container carrying
// `restartPolicy: Always` — and that is load-bearing in three separate ways
// (ADR-052 §14):
//
//  1. Job completion. As an ordinary entry in `.spec.containers`, this
//     process would never exit, and a pod reaches Succeeded only when every
//     one of its containers has. Every `mode: Job` workload asking for a
//     persisted workspace would hang until a deadline killed it. Nothing
//     caught this because every sandbox so far is `mode: Service`.
//
//  2. Termination ordering. The kubelet stops native sidecars only AFTER the
//     regular containers have exited, which is exactly the ordering a final
//     checkpoint needs: the workload stops mutating the tree, and only then
//     is the tree read. An ordinary sidecar gets SIGTERM alongside the
//     workload and would snapshot a workspace still being written.
//
//  3. Startup ordering. Init containers run in order, and a native sidecar
//     starts only after the plain init containers before it have completed.
//     So `workspace-restore` finishes populating the volume before this
//     process starts, and this process is serving before the workload runs.
//
// The ordering in 3 is why the caller must append these two in this order and
// keep the sidecar last.
//
// §14.2 changes: both containers mount a staging emptyDir (`ws-staging`) for
// squashfs archive and FUSE working directories. The sidecar additionally
// requires FUSE device access (device 229) for squashfuse and fuse-overlayfs.

	// produces files the other cannot modify — which on a git tree surfaces as
	// a permission error deep inside an unrelated operation rather than as
	// anything about ownership.
	//
	// The sidecar's SecurityContext is extended with FUSE device access (§14.2)
	// because squashfuse and fuse-overlayfs require /dev/fuse.
	// The FUSE sidecar is PRIVILEGED, and that is the honest cost of §14.2.
	//
	// An earlier version of this asked for `SYS_ADMIN` with
	// allowPrivilegeEscalation=false and runAsNonRoot=true, described in the
	// ADR as "narrower than SYS_ADMIN". That combination cannot mount anything,
	// for four independent reasons:
	//
	//  1. Bidirectional mount propagation — without which the workload cannot
	//     see the overlay at all — is rejected by the kubelet on a
	//     non-privileged container.
	//  2. /dev/fuse does not exist in the container. Kubernetes SecurityContext
	//     has no `devices` field; exposing a device needs a device plugin or
	//     privileged mode. squashfuse fails with "device not found".
	//  3. allowPrivilegeEscalation=false sets NoNewPrivs, which blocks setuid
	//     execution — and squashfuse and fuse-overlayfs both mount through
	//     fusermount3, which is setuid root.
	//  4. A capability added to a container that then setuids to a non-root
	//     user is dropped from the effective set unless the binary carries file
	//     capabilities. These do not.
	//
	// So the choice is privileged or no FUSE, and the ADR should say so rather
	// than describe a middle ground that does not exist.
	//
	// SUPERSEDED BY ADR-052 §14.7. The justification that followed here -- that the
	// container is platform-authored and platform-owned, so the tenant's own
	// container being unprivileged is enough -- does not hold. Pod Security
	// Admission evaluates the WHOLE Pod, and this Pod exists to run tenant
	// code. A privileged container beside that code produces a privileged Pod
	// containing untrusted workload; who wrote the Pod spec is not a trust
	// boundary, and no namespace this Pod could be moved to changes that.
	//
	// The result is that no sandbox requesting a durable workspace is admitted
	// into a tenant namespace at all:
	//
	//   pods "ej-sandbox-..." is forbidden: violates PodSecurity
	//   "restricted:latest": privileged (container "workspace-sync" must not
	//   set securityContext.privileged=true) ...
	//
	// §14.7 moves the mount to platform-owned node storage infrastructure, where
	// the privilege belongs to a component running no tenant code. This container
	// is what that replaces.
	//
	// The SHARED instance is separable and smaller: oranger ADR-002 §5 already
	// decided it runs unprivileged, and it does drop `privileged` -- it holds uid
	// 0 only to chown a reserved directory its sibling created as root. See
	// §14.7's conformance fix.
	// RESTRICTED, both instances, no exceptions (§14.7).
	//
	// §14.2 ran this container `privileged` with `runAsUser: 0` so squashfuse
	// and fuse-overlayfs could mount an archive. Pod Security Admission
	// evaluates the WHOLE Pod and this Pod runs tenant code, so that made every
	// workspace-bearing sandbox inadmissible in a tenant namespace -- the
	// EphemeralJob was created, the operator retried forever, and nothing
	// reported a policy decision.
	//
	// §14.7 takes the exit §14.2 named for itself: "the fallback is the §14
	// content-addressed path, which needs none of it." Restore is file-by-file
	// from content-addressed objects, which needs no device, no setuid helper
	// and no mount propagation -- so none of the four reasons privilege was
	// unavoidable for the archive path applies here.
	//
	// uid 1000 matches the workload and the pod's own RunAsUser. That equality
	// is load-bearing: the two processes write one volume, and a mismatch
	// produces files the other cannot modify. It is also what removes the last
	// reason this container held root -- the restore chowns the tree it just
	// wrote, and a process chowning its own files to its own uid needs no
	// privilege. Running ONE instance as root was what made the other's chown
	// fail; running both as 1000 makes the operation a no-op that succeeds.
