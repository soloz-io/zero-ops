// The two decisions that differ between environments, as interfaces.

// Everything else — records, hosts, Ready ranking, the state machine, the
// refusal shapes, the proxy — is one implementation. What varies is only how a
// caller is identified and how a browser is admitted to a preview host. The
// platform implementations (gateway identity, handoff-and-cookie session) are
// in platform.go; any other implementation lives in its own package, so this
// package never branches on an environment.

	// siblings): then only Namespace is searched.
