// The hub's public ingress address, resolved in-cluster.
//
// This is the address the hub Gateway and its HTTPRoutes publish their hostnames
// at -- the CAPH-managed control-plane load balancer, which also carries public
// ingress on 80/443 (ADR-046 §25.3). Every public URL for the box depends on it.
// Without it external-dns has no target, reports "All records are already up to
// date" against an empty zone, and infisical, argocd, auth, id, dashboard and api
// are all NXDOMAIN with ACME unable to issue for any of them.
//
// It used to arrive as a Day-0 chart value, which was wrong twice over.
//
// It did not work: ADR-072 made the tenant's repository authoritative, so the
// seed a tenant box runs is the one that repository declares, and a value the CLI
// resolved and injected into its OWN rendered seed reached nothing.
//
// And it could not be repaired the way this platform promises repairs arrive. A
// customer upgrades a bundle version; they do not run a CLI, edit their
// repository, or rebuild a cluster. A fix that needs Day-0 to re-run reaches only
// clusters built after the fix, which in production is none of them.
//
// The address was never a Day-0 fact. kubeadm records it on every cluster, in
// kube-system/kubeadm-config, because it is how the cluster describes itself.
// Reading it there makes the repair a bundle upgrade and nothing else, and makes
// it self-healing: a load balancer replaced later is picked up on the next
// reconcile rather than frozen at whatever Day-0 saw once.
//
// kubeadm-config rather than the HetznerCluster, though both carry it: this is
// provider-neutral, needs no CAPI CRDs present, and cannot be confused with a
// SPOKE's address. A hub that has provisioned spokes holds several
// HetznerClusters -- acme-hub-gx2ps at 65.109.41.89 beside
// spoke-pool-hybrid-dev-01-mqcqk at 65.109.41.65 -- and selecting the wrong one
// publishes a spoke's address for every hub hostname: DNS resolves, the port
// answers, and it is the wrong cluster. kubeadm-config is about THIS cluster by
// definition, so that mistake is not available.
//
// The general rule: if the platform can read it, the platform reads it. Day-0
// carries only what is genuinely external -- a tailnet key, a provider token,
// the tenant's domain.
