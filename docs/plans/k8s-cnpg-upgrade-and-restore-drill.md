# Plan: Kubernetes / CNPG upgrade track, then database restore drills (ADR-104)

**Owner:** Platform team (lead: Claude; execution: team member; approvals: user)
**Started:** 2026-10-15 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-20
**Status:** Phase 1 research complete. **Waiting on the user's decision D-TARGET** before the upgrade plan is written.

> **Rule for whoever picks this up:** no implementation until the user approves the upgrade
> plan and the read-only backup-access design. Verify every third-party claim at the
> DEPLOYED and TARGET release tags (never `main`/`master`); cite `URL@tag:line`.
> Several team-member claims were wrong when checked (see "Corrections"); do not reuse a
> version number from a report without re-checking it.

## 1. Why

- Both dev clusters (hub `nutgraf-hub`, spoke `nutgraf-01`) run **Kubernetes v1.31.6**, end of life.
- **CNPG 1.29.0** is end of life (1.29.x EOL 2026-09-29), and three patches behind.
- CNPG's built-in Barman (`spec.backup.barmanObjectStore`, used by both clusters) is
  **removed in CNPG 1.31.0** (CNPG v1.30 release notes; 1.31.0 not yet released).
- Restore drills were the original goal. They are now sequenced **after** the upgrade, and
  designed for the Barman Cloud **plugin**, the long-term backup mechanism.

## 2. Approved decisions (user, 2026-10-15)

1. Upgrade track first: Kubernetes **minor by minor** (no skipping); CNPG to a release
   supported on the target; built-in Barman → Barman Cloud plugin as its own validated change.
   Document every transitional version pair. *(Target version is now open: see D-TARGET.)*
2. One-off **interim restore proof** of the CURRENT built-in archive, before migrating:
   only with isolated capacity and read-only source access; otherwise recorded BLOCKED.
3. Read-only restore key from a **separate Hetzner project**, bucket policy granting only
   read actions on the two source prefixes; **test that write/delete are denied**. Separate
   evidence-writer key and evidence bucket.
4. Capacity gate covers restored size, WAL replay, temp files, PVC/storage-class limits,
   peak recovery CPU/memory and production headroom. A skip = durable evidence + alert,
   never green.
5. Monthly dev drills; GitOps `CronJob` (UTC), `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid` + Lease +
   idempotent run id; CI only tests/releases the runner.
6. Validation: database/owner checks + versioned app assertions **relative to the backup's
   recovery point**; row counts are sanity only.
7. Janitor never deletes an active restore: absent owner + expired Lease + timeout + grace;
   verify PVC/PV per reclaim policy.
8. Alerts in Grafana Cloud; failed / skipped / overdue (35 days) are distinct; a skip does
   not reset the last-success clock.
9. GitOps owns durable config; the runner has namespaced rights over drill resources only;
   a hub-database drill's scheduler must be **outside the hub's failure domain**.

## 3. Open decision for the user

**D-TARGET: Kubernetes target version.** The approved target was 1.36, but **no released
Kyverno supports 1.36** (Kyverno 1.19.x = K8s 1.33–1.35; 1.20 does not exist).

| Option | Summary | Lead's view |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Target **1.35** now; 1.36 as a follow-on once Kyverno supports it. 1.35 EOL 2027-02-28, so the follow-on is due within ~4 months. | **Recommended** |
| B | Keep 1.36; run Kyverno outside its matrix | Not recommended: Kyverno webhooks gate every deployment |
| C | Keep 1.36; wait for Kyverno before starting | Not recommended: already on EOL Kubernetes and CNPG |

| Barman plugin | latest v0.15.1 (2026-09-30) | releases |
| CAPI | v1.10, v1.11 EOL; v1.12 maintenance; current **v1.13.7**, **v1.14.3** (2026-10-07). **Skip upgrades: at most n-3 minors** | `cluster-api docs/book/src/reference/versions.md@v1.13.7:120-135`, releases |

| Crossplane | latest **v2.4.2**; 1.20 → 2.x is a **major** upgrade | releases |

### Restore mechanics (verified)

- Recovery at CNPG 1.29.0 (built-in): `spec.bootstrap.recovery.source` + `spec.externalClusters[].barmanObjectStore` with the source's exact `destinationPath` and `serverName` (`cloudnative-pg docs@v1.29.0 appendixes/backup_barmanobjectstore.md:273-319`).
- A recovery-only cluster must have **no `spec.backup`, no plugin WAL archiver, no custom archive command** (fail-closed preflight).
- Barman 3.10.0 restore needs only **`s3:ListBucket` + `s3:GetObject`** (`EnterpriseDB/barman barman/cloud_providers/aws_s3.py@release/3.10.0:203,254,281,305`); write calls belong to backup commands only.
- Hetzner: S3 keys are read/write across their project by default; bucket policies can restrict an individual key from another project to selected actions (Hetzner S3 credentials FAQ).

## 5. Corrections log (team-member claims found wrong)

| Claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| CNPG 1.29 supports K8s 1.34–1.36 | 1.33–1.35 |
| CAPI target 1.11/1.12 | both EOL/maintenance; target 1.13 or 1.14 |
| Barman 3.18.0 in our image (read from `master`) | 3.10.0 |
| CNPG 1.30.2 | does not exist; v1.30.1 |
| Kyverno 1.20.0 supports 1.34–1.36; "ClusterPolicy removal" | Kyverno 1.20 does not exist; no policy rewrite needed |
| Crossplane target v2.1.0 | latest v2.4.2; major upgrade, own step |
| Uncited breaking-change claims (`system:kubelet-api-admin`, Cilium `CiliumEndpointSlice`, Kyverno report API) | dropped by the team member as uncitable in Revision 2 |

## 6. Phases and status

| # | Phase | Status | Gate to leave it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Research: capacity, reuse, read-only key design (Part A); inventory, compat matrix, CAPI mechanics, breaking changes (Part B) | **Done** (Revision 2, with lead corrections above) | — |
| 2 | **D-TARGET** decision | **Waiting on user** | user picks A/B/C |
| 3 | Write the **upgrade plan** (ADR): minor-by-minor sequence; provider order (CAPH 1.0.7→1.1.8 first; kubeadm providers need an intermediate stop since 1.8.5→1.13 exceeds n-3; CAPI core 1.10→1.13 in one move); exact versions per step; Crossplane 1→2 as its own step; Postgres 16.2→latest 16.x; rollback per step; hub before or after spokes; CAPI template immutability (new-named classes/templates) | Not started | user approves the plan |
| 4 | Write the **read-only backup-access design**: separate Hetzner project, bucket policy (`s3:ListBucket` on the prefix + `s3:GetObject`), denial test plan | Not started (design inputs complete) | user approves |
| 5 | **Interim restore proof** (decision 2): one manual restore of the hub archive on `flatcar-hub-node-1`, user-run from a runbook, read-only key | Not started | depends on 4 |
| 6 | Execute the upgrade, step by step | Not started | each step's checks; user-run |
| 7 | Built-in Barman → Barman Cloud plugin migration (own ADR) | Not started | after 6 reaches a CNPG version with the plugin path validated |
| 8 | **ADR-104** restore drills (plugin-based) + implementation: namespace/quota/netpol/RBAC, CronJob + Lease, runner image via CI, fail-closed preflight `104-restore-drill.sh`, evidence store, janitor, Grafana alerts | Not started | after 7 |

## 7. Immediate next step

1. User answers **D-TARGET**.
2. Lead re-confirms the three "re-confirm" rows in §4 (ArgoCD, cert-manager, Postgres image)
   at their tags, then writes the upgrade plan (phase 3) and the access design (phase 4)
   for approval.

## 8. Artefacts

- Team-member reports (may be git-ignored; this plan carries their verified content):
  `scratch-pad/cnpg-restore-drill-phase1-report.md`, `scratch-pad/k8s-cnpg-upgrade-phase1-report.md`.
- Memory note: `db-restore-drill-and-upgrade-decisions`.
- Existing recovery runbooks to reuse (not to run for drills): `docs/runbooks/platform-db-restore.md`,
  `docs/runbooks/spoke-database-loss-and-recovery.md`. Do **not** run `make cnpg-bump-incarnation`
  or `cnpg-settle-incarnation` for a drill: they change the production incarnation.
