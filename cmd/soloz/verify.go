// soloz verify — does this hub actually serve, and by when?
//
// Bootstrap already reports success when its phases complete, which is not the
// same claim. Everything after the last phase is convergence: ArgoCD pulling
// charts, ESO waiting on a secret store another controller is still writing,
// operators reconciling in no particular order. A tenant watching a workflow go
// green has no way to tell that apart from a platform that is up.
//
// Bounded on purpose. "Not converged in fifteen minutes" is an answer a tenant
// can act on; a check that waits forever is a hung workflow, and one that
// samples once at the end of bootstrap reports failures that fix themselves a
// minute later.
