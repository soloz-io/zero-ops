// # WHY THIS COMMAND EXISTS
//
// The provider configuration and the control-plane template are Day-0 artefacts:
// the provisioner creates the Secret and applies the ClusterClass while building a
// cluster, and NOTHING reconciles either afterwards. Neither ClusterClass is synced
// by ArgoCD -- they are applied from the CLI's embedded assets -- so a release does
// not put the new template on a running cluster and a running cluster has no
// provider configuration at all.
//
// That left every existing box unable to adopt the control the ADR requires, with a
// runbook whose first step was to sync something nothing syncs. This is that step.
//
// It is deliberately not a reconciler. Adopting the template ROLLS THE CONTROL
// PLANE, and the migration that follows rewrites every Secret in the cluster with a
// verification step between each stage; a controller doing that unattended would be
// a component able to take a cluster's Secrets with it if its idea of the current
// key were ever wrong (ADR-100 takes the same position on rotation).

ONE thing is applied: the Secret the control plane reads its encryption provider
configuration from. It is per cluster, sourced from that cluster's escrow, and
nothing reconciles it -- which is why this command exists.

THE CLUSTERCLASS IS NOT APPLIED BY DEFAULT, AND THE TWO CLASSES DIFFER:

  a WORKLOAD cluster's    manifests/providers/<provider>, synced by ArgoCD's
                          infrastructure-provider ApplicationSet. Promoting a bundle
                          puts it on the box. Applying it from here would make the
                          CLI a second writer for a GitOps-owned object.

  the MANAGEMENT cluster's  internal/assets/manifests/classes/, embedded in this
                            binary and synced by NOTHING. It is applied once at Day-0
                            and never reconciled, so --apply-class is the only way it
                            ever changes -- and its live state can differ from the
                            repository with nothing reporting it.

So: no flag for a spoke, --apply-class for the hub.

Adopting a new template ROLLS THE CONTROL PLANE -- each node is replaced, because
the file and the mount are part of a node's bootstrap and nothing rewrites them in
place. That roll is triggered by the sync, not by this command.

RUN THIS AGAINST THE MANAGEMENT CLUSTER, for any cluster. The Secret lives in
platform-capi beside the CAPI objects, which are on the hub even for a workload
cluster -- --cluster names whose key it is, --kubeconfig says where CAPI lives.

IT IS TWO PHASES. The template adopted here (v3) delivers the file and the mount and
nothing that READS them, so a node that comes up with the file missing or misnamed is
an ordinary healthy node you can inspect. The 'encryption-provider-config' argument --
which makes the API server REQUIRE the file, and refuse to start without it -- arrives
in v4, after a replaced node has been checked. Each phase is a separate roll.

The key is restored from the escrow when one holds it and generated otherwise. A
generated key is escrowed before anything is applied: a cluster encrypting etcd with
a key held nowhere else is worse off than one not encrypting it, because losing the
control plane then takes every Secret AND every backup of them.

This is step 1 of docs/runbooks/encrypt-secrets-at-rest.md. The steps that follow --
verify, rewrite every Secret, verify in etcd, remove the plaintext fallback, verify
again -- are not performed here and are not optional.`,
