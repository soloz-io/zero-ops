// newEscrowVerifyRecoveryCmd proves the escrowed encryption key can actually DECRYPT
// a cluster, rather than merely being present under the right name.
//
// WHY PRESENCE IS NOT THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS.
//
// `soloz escrow verify` answers "is there a value under secret-encryption-key, and
// what is its fingerprint". That is worth asserting and it is not recovery. Both
// clusters' etcd is now encrypted (ADR-003 section 6), so on a rebuild the escrowed
// key is the only thing standing between a restored etcd and total loss -- and the
// question nobody has answered is whether the value in the escrow is the key the API
// server is actually using. A 64-byte string under the right name that decrypts
// nothing looks identical in a verify listing.
//
// The failure mode is the worst shape available: it is discovered during a recovery,
// which is the one moment it cannot be repaired. ADR-076 makes the escrow mandatory
// for exactly that reason, and this closes the gap between "escrowed" and "usable".
//
// So this takes one value as etcd stores it, and decrypts it with the escrowed key.
// If that works, the escrow recovers the cluster. If it does not, the escrow holds
// something else and we would rather know now.
//
// IT PRINTS NEITHER THE KEY NOR THE PLAINTEXT. The key opens every Secret on the box
// and the plaintext is a Secret. Both are reported as sha256 fingerprints, which is
// enough to compare two runs and useless to anyone reading the terminal over a
// shoulder or a transcript afterwards.

Presence is not recovery. ` + "`escrow verify`" + ` reports that a value exists under
secret-encryption-key; this reports whether that value is the key the cluster's API
server is actually encrypting with. A key that decrypts nothing is indistinguishable
from a working one in a presence check, and the difference surfaces during a rebuild,
which is the one moment it cannot be fixed.

Obtain the input on a control-plane node, where it never leaves the host:

  kubectl -n kube-system exec etcd-$NODE -- sh -c 'ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
    --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
    --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
    --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
    get /registry/secrets/default/enc-probe' > /tmp/probe.bin

it is one command away from plaintext and there is no reason for it to be a credential.
