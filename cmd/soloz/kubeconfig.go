// identity provider is down, the cluster is broken, or nobody is left who can

This is break-glass access. Normal access is through your own identity provider,
where each person authenticates as themselves. Use this when that is not available:
the identity provider is down, the cluster is broken, or nobody can log in.

The escrow is the Infisical you supplied at scaffold time, reached with the same
four values the cluster uses:

  INFISICAL_ESCROW_URL         usually https://app.infisical.com
  INFISICAL_ESCROW_PROJECT_ID
  INFISICAL_ESCROW_CLIENT_ID
  INFISICAL_ESCROW_CLIENT_SECRET

The credential it returns is cluster-admin and is not scoped to a person. Prefer
the identity provider wherever it is working, and treat what this prints as
something to use and discard.`,
