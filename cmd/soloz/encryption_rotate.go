// newEncryptionRotateCmd replaces a cluster's at-rest encryption key.
//
// WHY THIS IS STAGED AND NOT ONE COMMAND.
//
// `secretbox` writes with the FIRST key in the provider list and reads with any of
// them. So the only safe rotation is ordered:
//
//	new key first, old key retained  ->  rewrite every Secret  ->  verify every
//	object now carries the NEW key's name  ->  remove the old key  ->  verify again
//
// Removing the old key before the rewrite is verified makes every object still sealed
// under it unreadable. That is why this command has two stages and refuses to do the
// second until the first is proven, rather than being a single apply that happens to
// be run twice.
//
// WHY THE KEY NAME CARRIES A GENERATION. The API server writes the key's NAME into
// every stored object -- `k8s:enc:secretbox:v1:<name>:<nonce><ciphertext>` -- so after
// a rotation the prefix in etcd says which generation sealed each Secret. That is what
// turns "every Secret has been rewritten" from an assumption into a count. With one
// fixed name the two generations are indistinguishable in etcd and the rewrite cannot
// be proven, which after a key disclosure is the same as not having done it.
//
// THIS EXISTS BECAUSE A KEY WAS DISCLOSED, not as a routine capability. ADR-003 §6
// recorded rotation as unsupported, which was true and is why the disclosure on
// 2026-10-05 had no remedy. Separate from ADR-100: KMS v2 makes rotation the key
// store's concern, and this is the procedure for the provider in force today.

		Use:   "rotate",
		Short: "Replace a cluster's at-rest encryption key, in two verified stages",
		Long: `Replace the key Secrets are encrypted with, without losing the data already written.

STAGE 1 (default) mints a new key, makes it the write key, and RETAINS the current one
for reads. Nothing is unreadable at any point. Then, per
docs/runbooks/encrypt-secrets-at-rest.md: roll the control plane, rewrite every Secret,
and verify in etcd that every object carries the new key's name.

STAGE 2 (--finalize) removes the retained key. It refuses unless the live configuration
is actually mid-rotation, and it is the step that makes a disclosed key worthless --
so it must not be run until the rewrite has been verified, because anything still
sealed under the old key becomes unreadable.

Both stages escrow before they apply (ADR-076). During a rotation the escrow holds BOTH
keys, because a cluster that loses its control plane mid-rotation needs both to recover.

WHEN TO RUN IT. The cryptoperiod is ` + strconv.Itoa(assets.EncryptionRotationWindowDays()) + ` days for
both providers, and it is the same constant the Cloud KMS key uses -- the key that sits on
the control-plane host has no business outliving the non-exportable one.

That window governs keys that have NOT left their trust boundary. One that has is an
incident, not a scheduling question: it is replaced now. Waiting for the next window on
a key you know was disclosed keeps a compromised key in force for a quarter.`,
