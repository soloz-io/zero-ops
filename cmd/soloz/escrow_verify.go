//
// Preflight 91 checks that ADR-076's list and the escrow implementation name the
// same artefacts. That is a static check and it passed while the escrow held
// nothing for two of them, because names agreeing says nothing about presence.
//
// A recovery runs from what is in the escrow, not from what the ADR says should be.
// So presence is checked against the escrow itself, which needs credentials and
// therefore cannot live in a build-time gate.
//
// It prints FINGERPRINTS, never values. The point is to answer "is it there, and is
// it the same thing the box is using" without putting a root secret in a terminal
// or a CI log.
