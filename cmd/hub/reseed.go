// newReseedCmd re-applies the seed Application to a cluster that already exists.
//
// The seed Application is written once, at bootstrap, and carries the parameters
// the environment-manager chart renders from. A parameter added to the renderer
// afterwards reaches new clusters only — on a running one the chart renders
// without it and every Application generated from it fails comparison, which
// ArgoCD reports as sync status Unknown rather than as an error. Auto-sync fires
// only on OutOfSync, so the change appears pushed and nothing deploys.
//
// This command exists so that state is corrected from the renderer rather than
// by patching the live Application, which would leave the repository disagreeing
// with the cluster and the fix lost to whoever reads the repository next.
//
// The cluster's identity is read back from the seed rather than accepted as
// flags. Supplying it by hand invites supplying it differently, and topology in
// particular is a path segment: a plausible-looking value repoints an
// ApplicationSet at a directory that does not exist, and its Applications go
// missing rather than failing.

newly bootstrapped clusters.

Application, so a reseed cannot change which cluster the seed describes.

never the boundary AppProjects, so an opened boundary is not re-gated.`,
