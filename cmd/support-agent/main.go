// The Support Agent: a bounded control-plane evidence collector.
//
// ADR-077 defines what this is and, as importantly, what it is not. It holds no
// Kubernetes read access — its ClusterRole grants `create` on tokenreviews and
// subjectaccessreviews and nothing else — and it reaches the platform's
// components over HTTP the way any scraper would. It has no Service, no Ingress
// and no ingress NetworkPolicy rule, so nothing can reach it.
//
// It ships to every box and is inert until enrolled. Enrolment is a client
// certificate existing on disk (ADR-077 addendum 1); there is no token. An
// unenrolled box is not degraded, it simply has nowhere to report, and that is
// the honest meaning of "what is not observed is not supported" (ADR-067).
