// Package platform resolves the platform content the CLI needs at Day-0.
//
// ADR-063 requires a release to carry a build a tenant can run. That was untrue:
// bootstrap read manifests/ from the working directory in seven places, so the
// published binary only worked inside a checkout of zero-ops. A tenant obtaining
// the CLI from a release could not use it, and the custody claim -- that a box is
// installable from artefacts the tenant holds -- was false for the one artefact
// the tenant runs first.
//
// The rule is ADR-068's, applied to content rather than to versions: an
// unreleased build reads the working tree, a released build reads what it
// carries. A development build must keep reading the tree, or a change to a
// manifest would not take effect until it was published.
