// WS4 — hub public domain authority (ADR-051).
//
// ADR-051 names the environment overlay the system of record for the base domain
// and calls the hostname literals scattered through the hub manifests debt to be
// retired against it. This is the derivation half of that retirement: one value in,
// the complete endpoint set out, no per-hostname knobs.
//
// The hub-CLI derives rather than hub-operator because the artifacts land in a Git
// working tree and the operator has no Git write path (WS4 §1.2). The CLI already
// writes and commits ADR-045 artifacts, so this is the component already doing the
// job, not a new capability.

// HubEndpoints is the complete set of public hostnames for one hub environment.
//
// Every field derives from Zone. Exposing the set as a struct rather than a map is
// deliberate: a caller cannot ask for a hostname that the derivation does not
// define, so a new endpoint has to be added here and reviewed once rather than
// invented at each call site — which is how the literals accumulated.
type HubEndpoints struct {
	// Zone is the base domain: dev.nutgraf.in, stg.nutgraf.in, or the apex for
	// production. ADR-051's env-as-zone rule makes non-production zones carry the
	// environment as their leftmost label; production uses the apex unlabelled, so
	// the derivation below is identical for all of them.

	Console   string // Kratos self-service UI
	ArgoCD    string // ArgoCD server
	Infisical string // Infisical public endpoint
	MCP       string // OAuth redirect target (C7)

	// VictoriaMetrics carries an extra "hub." label no other host uses. WS4 §C1
	// requires this to be normalised or recorded as intentional; it is recorded
	// here so re-deriving it cannot silently change the hostname.

// DeriveHubEndpoints produces the endpoint set for a base domain.
//
// It is total and side-effect free so the migration can be diffed before anything
// is written: WS4-1 emits from this and compares against the literals currently in
// the manifests, and a difference is a bug or an undocumented exception rather than
// a surprise discovered at sync time.
