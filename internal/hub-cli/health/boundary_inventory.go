// BoundaryInventoryChecker asserts that a boundary generated the Applications it
// declares (ADR-061).
//
// Before ADR-061 a boundary's Applications were literal elements of the
// ApplicationSet, so applying the seed made them exist: there was nothing to
// check. Composing the inventory from descriptors makes it the result of a
// repository read that can return nothing, and a generator that returns nothing
// is not an error — the ApplicationSet reports healthy having produced zero
// Applications, which is indistinguishable from having nothing to produce.
//
// Without this gate the omission surfaces differently in each ADR-055 creation
// mode, and badly in both. Sequenced: the boundary phase reports success and the
// first symptom is a LATER phase timing out on a component whose Application was
// never created, attributing the failure to the component instead of the
// boundary. Converged: nothing is gated at all, so an absent Application is
// indistinguishable from the red-then-green convergence the mode exists to
// permit, and it may never surface.
//
// The expected count is assembled from the two sources the boundary is composed
// of, so it cannot drift from the inventory it describes:
//
//	descriptors on disk      manifests/argocd/components/<NN>/*.yaml
//	inline elements          list-generator elements on the live ApplicationSets
//
// Only STATICALLY KNOWABLE inventory is counted. Boundaries 05 and 06 generate
// from a matrix over the fleet registry, so their Application count is a
// function of how many tenants exist and is legitimately zero on a hub with
// none. Requiring a count there would fail every fresh bootstrap. What is still
// asserted for them is that the boundary rendered at all, and that nothing it
// produced is unable to read its source.
//
// This checker only reads. Day-0 continues to mutate boundary activation and
// nothing else, so ADR-055's disjoint authorities are unaffected.
