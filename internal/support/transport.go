// ADR-077 addendum 1 withdrew the enrolment-token exchange. In an
// agent-to-principal design the certificate IS the credential: the identity
// lives in it, the receiver validates it against its own CA, and revocation is a
// fingerprint blocklist at the receiving end. There is no token to leak, no
// first-use window during which a long-lived secret exists, and nothing for an
// operator to remember to rotate -- the leaf is short and reissues on the
// issuance machinery every box already runs (ADR-066).
//
// So "enrolled" means exactly one thing: a client certificate exists at these
// paths. Nothing else distinguishes an enrolled box from an unenrolled one, and
// an unenrolled box is not degraded -- it simply has nowhere to report.
