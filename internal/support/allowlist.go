// Package support implements the bounded evidence collection ADR-077 describes.
//
// The privacy boundary here is the allowlist, not anonymisation. Hashing a
// cluster name leaves identifying material in labels, image references, node
// names, annotations, addresses and error strings, so what is bounded has to be
// what is GATHERED rather than how it is disguised. Two levels enforce that:
//
//	collectors  where evidence comes from, and the schema of what comes back.
//	            Each runs a defined query whose result shape is known in
//	            advance. An agent that issued a caller-supplied query and
//	            shipped the response would have an allowlist filtering labels
//	            over an unbounded payload, which is a preference and not a
//	            boundary.
//	emit        which fields of that known schema leave the cluster. Default
//	            exclusion: a field nobody listed is a field that does not go.
//
// The tenant may subtract further. Effective scope is `allowlist − denylist`,
// computed in the cluster, so the platform proposes and can never silently add.
