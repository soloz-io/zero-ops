// Package health provides a unified framework for waiting on platform service
// readiness during bootstrap and Day-0 choreography.
//
// The package follows SOLID principles:
//
//   - Single Responsibility: each HealthChecker checks exactly one service.
//   - Open/Closed: new dependencies are added by writing a new HealthChecker,
//     never by modifying HealthWaiter.
//   - Liskov Substitution: any HealthChecker is interchangeable.
//   - Interface Segregation: HealthChecker has one method (Check).
//   - Dependency Inversion: HealthWaiter depends on the HealthChecker interface,
//     not on concrete service types.
//
// Two execution strategies are supported transparently behind the interface:
//
//  1. Kubernetes-clientset checkers (see clientset.go) for typed API access.
//  2. Kubectl-exec checkers (see kubectl.go) for resources that need shelling out
//     (CRD discovery, multi-namespace scans, JSONPath filtering).
//
// A HealthChecker picks its strategy internally and is called the same way.

// HealthChecker is the contract for a single platform-service readiness check.
//
// Implementations should be stateless and safe for concurrent use.
// Each Check call performs a SINGLE poll, not a loop. The HealthWaiter
// owns the polling cadence.

	// describing WHY it is not yet ready. The error message is shown to
	// operators and should be actionable.

}

// BootstrapReadinessCheck is the contract for an ordered set of HealthChecker
// instances representing the readiness profile of a specific bootstrap phase
// (e.g., "Day-0 data layer", "platform services").
//
// The same interface is used by Cobra commands and orchestrators to express
// "this phase is ready when all of these checks pass".

//
// Behavior:
//   - Each check is polled at the configured Interval until it returns nil.
//   - The first failing check blocks the sequence; later checks are skipped.
//   - If Timeout elapses before all checks pass, an error is returned
//     identifying which check failed and how long was waited.
//   - If ctx is cancelled, ctx.Err() is returned immediately.
