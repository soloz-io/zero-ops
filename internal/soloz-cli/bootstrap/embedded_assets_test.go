// The embed set is an allowlist (scripts/package/embed-platform-assets.sh), and a
// development build never consults it: ADR-068 sends a development binary to the
// working tree, where every manifest exists. So a Day-0 read of a path outside the
// set passes every local test and fails at a tenant's first bootstrap, with a
// "no such file or directory" naming a file the repository plainly has.
//
// These tests ask the embedded tree for what Day-0 actually reads. They fail at
// pull-request time rather than at release time, which is the difference between
// noticing and shipping.
//
// The dimensions are read from the working tree rather than listed here, so a new
// provider, environment or boundary is covered by existing tests on the commit
// that adds it -- a list would have to be remembered, and the thing being guarded
// against is precisely a set that someone forgot to extend.
