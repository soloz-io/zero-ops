// What must be TRUE for a phase to count as done, as distinct from what the
// phase does.
//
// A registry rather than a check written at the call site, because two readers
// need the same answer and they must not be able to disagree:
//
//	runFresh            -- skip this phase, or run it again?
//	handleExistingState -- is this bootstrap actually finished?
//
// The second is where the absence of this cost the most. A bootstrap that
// recorded `complete` refused every later run with "Cluster already
// bootstrapped. No further CLI operations permitted per ADR-040" -- so a box
// whose identity provider had never served could not be repaired by the tool
// that built it, and the phase-level check below would never be reached to
// notice. Completion has to be verified at the point it is claimed, and the
// outermost claim is the one that shuts the door.
//
// ADR-040 is not weakened by this. It bars the CLI from operating a cluster that
// is built; it does not require the CLI to believe a record over the cluster it
// can see. A phase whose postcondition fails was never built in the first place.
//
// Sparse on purpose. A phase absent from this map keeps exactly its previous
// behaviour, so postconditions are adopted where they earn their keep rather
// than invented for twenty-four phases at once. The bar for adding one: it is
// cheap, it is read-only, and it answers "did this phase's effect actually
// happen" rather than "did the command exit zero".
