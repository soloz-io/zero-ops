// What every Day-0 boundary must answer before the next one may start.
//
// ADR-055 decides when a boundary is ACTIVATED. Nothing decided when one is
// DONE, and the gap was not theoretical: `awaitBoundaryInventory` became the
// de-facto contract by being the only thing all six called, and it answers "did
// ArgoCD generate the Applications" -- never "is what this boundary produced
// usable by the next one".
//
// So each boundary grew its own assertions reactively, one outage at a time.
// Before this table, four of the six assertions in the platform had been added
// after debugging a specific failure, and boundaries 02, 05 and 06 asserted
// nothing at all -- not as a decision, but because nobody had been burned there
// yet. Boundary 03 was the one that cost the most: it reported success when
// ArgoCD had applied the HubEnvironment, while the hub-operator went on to spend
// nine more minutes creating the database roles, and boundary 04 deployed
// Zitadel against a database whose roles did not exist.
//
// # Why this cannot be escaped
//
// The declarations below are UNKEYED struct literals. Go requires every field of
// an unkeyed literal to be present, so:
//
//   - a boundary that omits an answer does not compile;
//   - a field added here breaks every boundary until each one answers it.
//
// The compiler is the enforcement, not review. `readiness` adds the second half:
// its zero value is not a valid declaration, so "I forgot" and "I decided
// nothing is needed" cannot be spelled the same way. Declaring nothing is
// allowed and requires a reason, exactly as the architecture gate's waivers do.

	// in readiness: readiness asks a question, this changes something.

	// What must be TRUE before THIS boundary may start.
	//
	// The half the contract was missing, and its absence produced a deadlock.
	// Boundary 03 was made to assert "the platform's database roles exist"
	// because boundary 04 needs them -- but the hub-operator that creates them
	// cannot start until `bootstrap-infisical-api` writes the infisical-auth
	// Secret, and that phase runs AFTER boundary 03:
	//
	//   11e  boundary-03               deploys the hub-operator
	//   11f  bootstrap-infisical-api   creates infisical-auth
	//
	// So the boundary waited 15 minutes for work that could not begin until it
	// returned. A guarantee belongs to the boundary that can satisfy it; a
	// requirement belongs to the boundary that needs it. Collapsing the two into
	// one field forces every dependency to be expressed as the producer's
	// postcondition, even when the producer is not the one able to wait.
