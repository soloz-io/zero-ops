// Zitadel's initialisation is not transactional, so a failed one cannot be
// retried -- it can only be started again from an empty database.
//
// cmd/setup writes to two places: the event stream, and projections.migrations,
// which is the record of what it has done. If it fails between them it leaves a
// database in which work has happened and nothing recorded it. Every retry then
// re-runs 03_default_instance, collides with the instance_domain constraint its
// predecessor wrote, fails with AlreadyExists, and -- by its own log -- "setup
// failed, skipping cleanup". The Job retries until backoff, identically, for
// ever.
//
// The comment in the chart's values assumed the opposite: "restartable by
// design -- cmd/setup runs cleanup on interruption so a retry can pick up where
// we left off". That is true of INTERRUPTION. It is not true of FAILURE, which
// takes the path that skips cleanup.
//
// This was found the slow way. The visible symptom was an ExternalSecret in a
// different namespace stalling for eleven minutes on every run, because Zitadel
// never came up, so iam-admin-pat was never created, so the identity token was
// never uploaded for ESO to deliver.
//
// So initialisation is treated as ATOMIC AT THE DATABASE, which is the same
// contract CNPG already states with `bootstrap: initdb` versus `recovery`, and
// the same one the database-recovery overlay applies to platform-db: a database
// whose initialisation did not complete is recreated, not repaired. That is safe
// precisely because incomplete initialisation means there is nothing to
// preserve.

	//
	// That is false. Zitadel v4.15.3 has no `projections.migrations` table at
	// all -- it keeps migration state as events in the eventstore, and its
	// projections schema holds a hundred other tables. The signature was inferred
	// from a broken box and never checked against a working one, so it matched
	// EVERY healthy database. Verified afterwards on a running, serving box: the
	// query returned true.
	//
	// Only the "is it serving" gate stood between that and dropping a live
	// identity provider's database, and a Zitadel restarting briefly satisfies it.
	//
	// The drop is gone rather than re-specified. It never fixed anything on this
