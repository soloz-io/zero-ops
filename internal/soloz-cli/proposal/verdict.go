// Package proposal produces the verdict ADR-067 requires a bundle proposal to
// carry.
//
// Not in internal/soloz-cli/preflight: that package validates the machine a
// Day-0 run is launched from -- docker present, token valid, image available.
// This one judges a version against a cluster that already exists. Sharing a
// name would invite one to grow into the other.
//
// ADR-064 proposes a version to a tenant; ADR-065 leaves the decision with the
// tenant; ADR-067 closes the gap between them: "An upgrade proposal is
// accompanied by a pre-flight verdict produced inside the box, against the
// cluster the proposal targets." Nothing did that. A proposal arrived as a
// dependency bump with release notes, and whether the version was safe for THIS
// cluster was a judgement the tenant had no way to make and the platform had no
// standing to make for them -- it holds no access to the cluster and never will
// (ADR-065).
//
// So the judgement is made where the cluster is, and only the verdict crosses
// the boundary. That is the whole shape of this package.
//
// The third outcome matters as much as the other two. A check that cannot run
// returns UNVERIFIED rather than passing: a verdict that silently degrades to
// "fine" when it cannot see anything is worse than no verdict, because it is
// indistinguishable from one that looked.
