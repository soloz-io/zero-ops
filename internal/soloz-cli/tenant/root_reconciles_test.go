// Application that owns generated/ and everything Day-0 writes there (ADR-045),
// was never applied and that Application was never created. Nothing reported it:
// the root was Synced and Healthy throughout, because it was correctly applying
// the one file it had been told about (see the ArgoCD false-green shapes: a
// component managing nothing looks exactly like a component with nothing to do).
//
// The cost was a box running on the platform's own Infisical project ids while
// its own sat in git, and hub-operator answering every reconcile with a 404.
//
// Asserted against the FILTER's effect on the files actually rendered, not
// against the filter's text. A rule that reads correctly and matches nothing is
