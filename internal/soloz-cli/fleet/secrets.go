// Package fleet reads what a fleet declares and reports what has been supplied.

// ADR-087 splits a fleet's runtime input by who owns the value. The secrets
// half is declared in the fleet's own repository and supplied out of band, and
// this package is the join between those two halves: the declaration, from git,
// and the key names present in the provider.
//
// Nothing here handles a secret VALUE. Supplying one is a write the caller
// performs; reporting on one is done by name. That is a property of the types,
// not a convention -- see infisical.ListSecretNames.
