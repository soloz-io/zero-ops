// EncryptionSecretName is the Secret a control plane reads its at-rest encryption
// provider configuration from, for one cluster.
//
// IT EXISTS SO THERE IS EXACTLY ONE SPELLING. The name appears in three places that
// cannot see each other: this file, the Day-0 Secret template rendered by the
// provisioner and by `soloz encryption enable`, and the `secretEncryptionConfig`
// patch in each ClusterClass, which builds it from `{{ .builtin.cluster.name }}`
// inside CAPI at topology-reconcile time. A mismatch between the Go half and the
// CAPI half produces a control-plane node referencing a Secret that does not exist,
// and CAPI reports that as a bootstrap that never completes rather than as a name it
// could not find. Preflight 003-encryption-secret-is-per-cluster asserts the two halves agree.
//
// The key is per cluster because ADR-100 decides it is and the escrow holds it under
// the cluster's id (ADR-076). An earlier version named one flat Secret for every
// cluster of a class, which is the defect this function's existence prevents.

// EncryptionKeyName is the name a given generation of the at-rest encryption key
// carries inside the provider configuration.
//
// IT IS NOT COSMETIC: the API server writes the key's NAME into every stored object,
// as `k8s:enc:secretbox:v1:<name>:<nonce><ciphertext>`. So the name in etcd says which
// generation sealed each Secret, and counting objects that still carry the previous
// name is how "every Secret has been rewritten under the new key" becomes a measured
// fact rather than an assumption.
//
// A single fixed name would make two generations indistinguishable in etcd, which
// would leave a rotation performed but unprovable — and after a key disclosure,
// unprovable is the same as unfinished.
//
// Generations start at 1 because the key store convention elsewhere in this platform
// does (ADR-100), and because 0 is what an unread value looks like.

// EncryptionRotationWindow is how often an at-rest encryption key is replaced.
//
// NINETY DAYS, FOR BOTH PROVIDERS, AND IT IS ONE NUMBER DELIBERATELY. The secretbox
// key and the Cloud KMS key protect the same data for the same reason, and two
// cryptoperiods would mean the weaker control could legitimately outlive the stronger
// one.
//
// WHAT "THE ENTERPRISE STANDARD" ACTUALLY SAYS, because it is worth not overstating:
//
//   - PCI DSS v4.0 req. 3.7.4 requires a cryptoperiod to be DEFINED and keys rotated at
//     the end of it. It names no number. The requirement is that somebody decided.
//   - NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 puts the originator-usage period of a symmetric
//     data-encryption key at up to two years. That is a ceiling, not a target.
//   - Cloud-provider convention is the tighter figure: Google's guidance for a
//     symmetric encryption key is 90 days; AWS KMS automatic rotation is annual.
//
// So no framework hands us 90. What decides it here is narrower and does not need one:
// ADR-100 already adopted at most 90 days for the Cloud KMS key, because the API server
// retains data encryption keys in memory and a key's exposure window is otherwise
// unbounded. `secretbox` keeps its key ON the control-plane host, which is strictly
// more exposed than a non-exportable key in an external authority — so it has no
// business carrying a LONGER cryptoperiod than the stronger control it is a stopgap
// for. 90 days is the tighter convention and the figure this platform already uses.
//
// A DISCLOSED KEY IS NOT A CADENCE MATTER, and this constant must not be read as
// permission to wait. A key known to have left its trust boundary is an incident: it is
// replaced now, and the 90-day clock is what governs keys that have not. Treating a
// disclosure as "due at the next window" is how a known-compromised key stays in force
// for a quarter.
//
// Referenced rather than restated: internal/platform/kms sets the Cloud KMS rotation
// period from this, `soloz encryption rotate` prints it, and ADR-100 records it. A
// second spelling of a cryptoperiod is a second policy.
const EncryptionRotationWindow = 90 * 24 * time.Hour

// EncryptionRotationWindowDays renders the window the way an operator reads it.
//
// time.Duration formats 90 days as "2160h0m0s", which is not a cryptoperiod anybody
// recognises in help text or in a runbook.

	return int(EncryptionRotationWindow.Hours() / 24)
