/**
 * The trusted channel between an application's BFF and its own SDK (ADR-057).
 *
 * Both halves of one rule, in one module, for one reason: they are a matched
 * pair of header names, and they were being written out by hand on both sides of
 * a call that crosses a repository boundary. oranger's SDK says so in its own
 * comment -- "the two are separate services with no shared module, so a rename
 * changes both files in one commit" -- which is a convention, not a mechanism.
 *
 * In waypoint the caller half is spelled in EIGHT places, each as
 * `process.env.WAYPOINT_INTERNAL_TOKEN ? { ... } : {}`. That ternary is the
 * defect this module removes: with the token absent the call is made with no
 * header at all, so it fails at the far end as a bare 401 naming nothing. A
 * missing credential should stop the caller, not travel.
 *
 * ADR-057 makes this safe only when BOTH hold: the token proves which service is
 * calling, AND a network policy lets nothing else reach the receiver. This module
 * is the first half. The second is the CiliumNetworkPolicy in the receiver's
 * chart, and neither is sufficient alone.
 *
 * SCOPE. This is an intra-application channel. It is not a cross-application
 * mechanism and must not become one: the identity here is ASSERTED by the caller,
 * which is acceptable between two workloads of one application in one namespace
 * and is not acceptable across an application boundary, where identity must come
 * from a validated token (ADR-094 invariant 2b).
