/**
 * The environment contract between the platform and an application.
 *
 * THE ONE PLACE these names are spelled. Every key here is written by the
 * platform -- the hub-operator into the tenant's Infisical folder, delivered by
 * an ExternalSecret, or a ConfigMap the tenant chart mounts -- and an application
 * that spells one itself has taken a copy of a platform decision.
 *
 * Why that matters beyond tidiness: when the platform renamed the caller
 * allowlist from a list to a map, every application that had written
 * `process.env.OIDC_ALLOWED_AZP` and split it on spaces was silently wrong, and
 * nothing in its own repository said so. A name read through this module moves
 * when the platform moves it, and a name that disappears is a type error rather
 * than an empty string.
 *
 * Nothing here is a default. A missing value is reported by the reader that needs
 * it, naming the key and what the application loses without it -- never filled in
 * with a fallback, because every fallback this package has carried pointed at
 * production.
