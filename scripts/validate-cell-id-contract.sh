# Validate the cell-id label contract that binds spokes to fleet Applications.
#
# Four links carry a spoke's identity from its SpokePool claim to the
# ApplicationSets that place tenants on it:
#
#   1. the SpokePool composition patches metadata.labels.cell-id onto the CAPI
#      Cluster, from the claim name
#   2. the same composition sets take-along-label.capi-to-argocd.cell-id, which
#      is what tells capi2argo to copy the label onward
#   3. capi2argo writes it to the ArgoCD cluster Secret        (runtime -- see the
#      Kyverno policy in manifests/hub-core-services/security/)
#   4. the fleet ApplicationSets select on it with a clusters generator
#      matchLabels
#
# Break any link and the clusters generator matches nothing. The result is not an
# error: the ApplicationSet generates zero Applications and reports Healthy doing
# it, so every tenant on every affected spoke silently stops being reconciled.
# That is the same false-green shape as an ApplicationSet whose generator returns
# an empty list, and nothing in ArgoCD distinguishes it from "there are no
# tenants yet".
#
# This script covers links 1, 2 and 4 -- everything that lives in Git. Link 3 is
# runtime and belongs to the Kyverno policy; the "generated nothing" symptom
# regardless of cause belongs to the ArgoCDApplicationSetGeneratesNothing alert.
#
# Depends on: yq (mikefarah), standard POSIX tools.
