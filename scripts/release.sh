#
# WHY ONE SCRIPT. Publishing and promoting are two halves of one intent, and
# doing them by hand has failed in three distinct ways that this sequence
# removes:
#
#   the version was bumped in values.yaml only, so the root Application synced
#   and every CHILD stayed pinned to the previous release -- reporting Synced
#   while shipping nothing (rc.111, rc.112);
#
#   the promotion commit was written against a stale checkout, so the push was
#   rejected and a later force would have discarded a CI bot's own commit;
#
#   .state/*.json was staged along with the version files, committing local
#   machine state into a tenant's repository.
#
# The ordering is deliberate and is the point: PULL, then compute the version,
# then publish, then promote. Computing the version before pulling reads a stale
# current version and can reuse one already published. Promoting before
# publishing writes a reference to an artefact that does not exist, which ArgoCD
# reports as a chart pull failure naming a version nobody can find.
