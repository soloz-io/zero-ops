# Full-environment teardown (hub + spoke).
#
# Sourced by hub-bootstrap.sh; invoked by `hub-bootstrap.sh <env> --teardown`.
#
# Three defects make a naive teardown leave paid infrastructure running, and each
# one is silent — the command exits 0 either way:
#
#   1. `hub teardown --name=<hub>` matches Hetzner resources by name/label
#      containing the HUB name (teardown/orchestrator.go:137). Spoke resources are
#      named spoke-pool-*, so the spoke is never touched. Tearing the hub down
#      first also removes the CAPI controllers that would have unwound the spoke,
#      which is why the spoke must go first.
#
#   2. `hub spoke teardown --name=<spoke>` is a no-op. discoverSpokeClusters
#      rebuilds the name from label parts as strings.Join(parts[2:5], "-")
#      (spoke/orchestrator.go:104), so caph-cluster-spoke-pool-hybrid-dev-01-*
#      yields "spoke-pool-hybrid" — which never equals "spoke-pool-hybrid-dev-01",
#      so the filter skips it. It must be called WITHOUT --name, which deletes
#      every spoke in the project; this script therefore takes an inventory first
#      and refuses if a spoke from another environment would be caught.
#
#   3. ArgoCD re-creates the SpokePool while it is being deleted, so the claim has
#      to be removed before the infrastructure.
#
# A verification sweep runs afterwards and deletes anything the CLI missed, scoped
# to this environment's names, because "teardown succeeded" with servers still
# billing is the failure mode being fixed.

# ─── Hetzner inventory ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Everything is scoped by exact name prefix (hub name, spoke name), never by a
# loose substring, so a teardown of dev can never reach stg or prod.
