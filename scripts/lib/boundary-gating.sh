# Boundary activation gating (ADR-055).
#
# Boundary CONTENT is reconciled from Git by the seed Application and needs no
# help from this script — that is the whole point of ADR-055, and the reason the
# old render-and-apply step that lived here is gone. What remains is the one
# thing Git deliberately does not own: boundary ACTIVATION.
#
# Activation is a deny sync window on each boundary's AppProject. It is excluded
# from Git reconciliation on purpose (it is the ADR-040 Day-0/Day-1 boundary),
# which means it is also the one piece of state that does NOT self-correct and is
# NOT reported as drift. A bootstrap interrupted between two boundary phases
# leaves a boundary closed forever, and nothing anywhere says so.
#
# This module is that missing check. It reports activation state, and closes the
# gap an interrupted run leaves behind.

# Resolve the management kubeconfig for the current cluster.
