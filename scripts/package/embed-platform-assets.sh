# platform manifests. go:embed cannot reach outside its own package directory, so

# The set is deliberately narrow. Embedding manifests/ wholesale would put a
# tenant's binary in the business of carrying every provider overlay, every
# component descriptor and every environment the platform has ever supported --
# most of which Day-0 never reads, and all of which would then need to stay
# correct in two places.

# Run by the release workflow, and by the pre-commit hook that verifies the copy
