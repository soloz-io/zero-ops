# Package the platform-owned components declared inline in the boundary

#
# ADR-061 puts a component inline when it needs the environment or provider
# dimensions in scope, which descriptors do not carry. Nothing connected that
# list to the packager, so a released bundle named charts no release published
# and the gap was invisible until a cluster tried to reconcile one.
#
# Where the path is parameterised the content is packaged per combination, the
# same way boundary 02's provider overlays and the spoke catalogue are: the
# overlay is the variation, and reconstructing it from values would let the
# combinations drift apart.
