"""Fold the packaged component charts into the one published distribution.

ADR-063: a version names one artefact. Components are internal structure, and
the environment and provider a cluster runs are values supplied to it rather
than names it resolves.

This reads the charts the existing packagers produce -- each already verified to
render what the cluster applies today -- and folds them into a single umbrella
chart whose subcharts are those components. Reusing their output rather than
re-rendering keeps that verification meaningful: what ships is what was checked.

Components whose content varies by environment or provider become one subchart
carrying every variant, deduplicated by document content. The variation is tiny
and the shared part is not: the spoke catalogue's six combinations differed by
thirty lines out of two hundred and three thousand while each carried the same
12.8MB of vendored CRDs, so publishing them separately shipped seventy megabytes
to express a nodeSelector. Deduplicating by content means this does not depend on
knowing which part of a component varies, which changes whenever an overlay does.

A component that is already a Helm chart is copied with its templates intact.
Its content depends on values only a cluster can supply -- a gateway's
external-dns target, a tenant's issuer -- so pre-rendering it here would bake one
cluster's answer into every cluster's copy, which is what ADR-062 forbids and
what the first release of hub-environment-dev actually did.

Usage: distribution.py <version> <packaged-charts-dir> <out-dir>
