# Provenance: which source produced this artefact.
#
# Without it a published bundle records its own version and nothing else, so
# "what is in 0.1.16-rc.29?" has no answer that does not depend on someone
# remembering. Both callers build from a WORKING TREE -- the release workflow
# from a checkout, a developer from whatever is on their laptop -- and a bundle
# built from uncommitted edits is untraceable by construction: it is in a
# registry, tenants can pull it, and no commit corresponds to it.
#
# Recorded rather than enforced, FOR CHART CONTENT. Refusing to publish from a
# dirty tree would break the local release path this script exists to support
# (the whole point of testing a release before committing it), so the dirty state
# is stamped instead and shows up wherever the chart is inspected.
#
# THAT IS ONLY SAFE FOR DIRT THE CHART ITSELF CARRIES, and "dirty" was one word
# standing for two conditions:
#
#   manifests, and operators/*/config/   The chart content IS the dirty content.
#                                        kustomize reads those paths from this
#                                        tree, so the artefact is
#                                        self-consistent. A stamp is the right
#                                        answer and a local test is meaningful.
#
#   operator SOURCE (Go, Dockerfile,     The chart ships the dirty manifests, but
#   go.mod, cmd/, internal/, api/)       the IMAGE is built by a per-component CI
#                                        workflow from a COMMIT, which then
#                                        commits the resolved digest back. There
#                                        is no commit for uncommitted code, so no
#                                        image was ever built and the pin still
#                                        points at an older one. The artefact is
#                                        internally inconsistent: new manifests,
#                                        old binary.
#
# The second case cannot be stamped toward anything, and the warning's own advice
# -- "fine for a local release test" -- is false for it, because the local test
# exercises the old image. It is also invisible downstream: the chart renders, the
# digest is valid, and every Application reaches Synced, because an old image is a
# perfectly healthy image.
#
# It cost 0.1.16-rc.140: manager.yaml shipped a new TENANT_ID env var and the
# binary that reads it was never built. The same class cost rc.30 and rc.31, which
# is why publish.sh HARD-REFUSES a tree that is merely behind its upstream -- the
# milder version of this, where the right image exists and the tree just is not
# pointing at it. Refusing that while warning about this had the severities
# inverted against the harm.
#
# So it is split: refuse on image content, stamp chart content.
#
# Scoped to operators/ as a whole and not to a list of operators that currently
# ship. ephemeral-vm-provisioner and workspace-sync are not referenced by any
# component today; an exemption list would quietly stop covering them on the day
# they are, which is the day it matters.
