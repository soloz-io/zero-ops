"""Split a rendered component into verbatim content and templated objects.

The spoke catalogue is reconciled by every spoke, and a few of its fields must
differ per spoke: which Infisical path holds its credentials, which DNS zone it
may write, which backup prefix it owns. As a Kustomize source those were patches
on the Application. A published bundle makes the source a Helm chart, and ArgoCD
permits one source type per source, so the patches have nowhere to live and the
fields must come from chart values instead.

Objects named in the field declaration are emitted as Helm templates with those
paths substituted. Everything else -- the CRDs and the bulk of the catalogue --
stays verbatim under files/, because templating content that contains Go
delimiters of its own has silently blanked a credential here before.

An object named in the declaration that the render does not contain is an error,
not a no-op: a Kustomize patch whose target is missing fails the build, and
losing that would turn a stale declaration into a spoke reading another spoke's
secrets.

Delimiters already in a templated object are escaped before it becomes a
template. An ExternalSecret's template block legitimately contains `{{ .password }}`,
which is External Secrets Operator's syntax for the fetched value and not Helm's
-- rendered as Helm it becomes the empty string, and the credential is blanked
with no error anywhere. That is the whole reason verbatim content lives under
files/; an object that must be templated cannot, so its own delimiters are
protected instead.

A field either assigns a whole value (`value:`), substitutes a literal inside
one (`replace: {from:, with:}`) for values buried in an opaque blob no path can
address, or substitutes it throughout the object (`replaceAll: {from:, with:}`)
for objects that carry the same per-instance value in every field.

A component may render into several files. All of them are passed at once and a
declared object must appear in exactly one of them: checked per file, a
declaration would have to name objects that live in a different file, so every
multi-file component would fail on its first entry.

Usage: templated-fields.py <declaration.yaml> <chart-dir> <rendered.yaml>...
