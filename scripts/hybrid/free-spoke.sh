# Reclaim disk on the home-lab hosts, and hold every guest log to 24 hours.
#
# Why this exists — the 2026-09-25 outage, in full, because the failure mode is
# invisible from inside the cluster:
#
#   C:\ on the Dell box (both spoke VMs live there on dynamic VHDXes) reached
#   0 bytes free. Hyper-V reported "Disk Full" on each VHDX and paused the VM
#   for a critical error; thirty minutes later it turned both off. The kubelet
#   froze with the VM, so the nodes went NotReady six minutes apart — and no
#   disk-pressure event was ever raised, because kubelet's eviction thresholds
#   read the GUEST's 60 GB disk (two thirds empty) while the HOST backing it
#   had none left. Nothing on the host watches its own free space either.
#
#   The host was holding 44.7 GB of VHDX files no VM was attached to: the hub's
#   disk from when it still ran on the Dell, an old flatcar-node-1, WSL2
#   leftovers, test images. Plus temp and update caches. None of it is
#   reclaimable from inside a guest.
#
# What this script must never do again — its own first run, 20:40 IST the same
# day, deleted BOTH spoke VMs' live disks (flatcar-spoke-node-1/2.vhdx, 33 GB)
# while they sat powered off. The guard was `Get-VHD .Attached`, which is FALSE
# for an Off VM: nothing holds the file open, so an Off VM's disk looked
# exactly like a stale one. The guard is now the VM CONFIGURATION — any path
# `Get-VMHardDiskDrive` reports for any VM on the host, and any VM name
# matching the file's base name, is untouchable regardless of VM state.
# flatcar-base.vhdx stays skipped by name. The base image and the ignition
# artefacts survived that run (their guards were already name-based); the two
# spoke VHDXes did not, and there was no shadow copy to recover them from.
#
# So this sweeps the side kubelet cannot see and bounds the side it can.
#
#   ./free-spoke.sh
#
# No options, no modes, one full pass every time. Run it whenever the host is
# short of space. It takes MINUTES, not seconds — the compaction below rewrites
# multi-GB files and restarts VMs, so do not run it when you need the cluster up
# thirty seconds from now.
#
# Phase 1, every guest that answers (SSH on port 2220 + registry index, the same
# numbering provision-flatcar-worker.sh uses):
#
#   1. writes /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/24h.conf (MaxRetentionSec=1day,
#      SystemMaxUse=500M), restarts journald and vacuums the journal to 24h;
#   2. deletes rotated pod logs older than a day under /var/log/pods;
#   3. prunes unreferenced container images and exited sandboxes — normally the
#      LARGEST consumer on a k8s node, and the one nothing here used to touch:
#      kubelet's image GC does not fire until imagefs crosses 85%, which the
#      guest never reached because the HOST ran out first;
#   4. runs fstrim.
#
# Phase 2, once per host:
#
#   5. deletes VHDX files that no VM on that host references (by declared disk
#      path or by name) and nothing has attached — never flatcar-base.vhdx, the
#      pristine image the provisioner copies from;
#   6. deletes *.config.ign / *-ignition.iso only for VMs that no longer exist
#      on that host (a live VM keeps its ISO: its firmware still boots that
#      DVD, and Hyper-V fails the start when the file is gone);
#   7. empties C:\Windows\Temp and C:\temp (files older than a day), the recycle
#      bin, the Windows Update download cache, and superseded WinSxS components;
#   8. REPORTS, without touching: hiberfil.sys, C:\Windows.old, shadow-copy
#      usage, every .vhdx/.avhdx over 1 GB anywhere on C:, and any VM holding a
#      checkpoint. Each is a decision, not a sweep;
#   9. COMPACTS every disk a VM declares: stop the VM gracefully, Optimize-VHD
#      -Mode Full, restart it if it had been running;
#  10. prints free space before and after per host, and EXITS 1 if any host ends
#      below 20 GB free. That non-zero is the alarm: something is growing faster
#      than this script is run.
#
# Why 9 exists, and why the sentence "it never starts or stops a VM" is gone
# from this header: fstrim alone reclaims NOTHING on the host. A dynamically
# expanding VHDX only ever grows; TRIM marks blocks reusable inside the file so
# it stops growing, but the file stays at its high-water mark forever and every
# byte of that stays charged to C:. Optimize-VHD is the only thing that gives it
# back, and it requires the disk offline — so the VM must be Off. Step 4 without
# step 9 is the reason a run can report success while the host is still full.
#
# The two guards are deliberate inverses. DELETION asks "does any VM claim this
# file?" and refuses when the answer is yes — the lesson of the 20:40 incident
# above. COMPACTION only ever touches a path a VM explicitly declares through
# Get-VMHardDiskDrive, and only while that VM is confirmed Off. A file nobody
# claims is never compacted; flatcar-base.vhdx is skipped by name in both.
#
# Shutdown is always graceful, never a power-off. A guest that will not stop
# within 180s keeps its disk uncompacted and is restarted as it was: reclaiming
# disk is not worth corrupting a filesystem to do.
