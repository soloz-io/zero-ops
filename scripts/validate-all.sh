# repo-level checkers, a preflight phase, per-module cluster checks and the
# post-bootstrap components pass, each invoked from somewhere different, and the

# on this box?" had no answer that did not depend on someone remembering.
#
# So this writes .state/validation.json: one entry per phase, with its status,
# its counts, its exit code and where its output went. A phase that did not run
# is recorded as skipped WITH THE REASON, never omitted and never folded into the
# pass count -- the distinction between "checked and fine" and "never checked" is
# the one that matters, and it is exactly the one a summary line loses.

# Exit is non-zero if any phase failed. A skipped phase does not fail the run --
