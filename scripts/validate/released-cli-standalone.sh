# A released CLI must bootstrap from its binary alone.

# ADR-063 requires a release to carry a build a tenant can run. Bootstrap read
# platform manifests from the working directory, so the published binary worked
# only inside a checkout of zero-ops -- a hidden dependency on the vendor's
# repository, in the one artefact a tenant runs before it has anything else.
#
# The check runs the released binary from a directory that is not a checkout. A
# development build is expected to fail this and is not run: it reads the working
# tree by design (ADR-068), and a build that passed here in development mode
# would be one that had stopped reading the tree at all.
