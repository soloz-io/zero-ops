"""Fail when a reusable workflow reads a secret it does not declare.

GitHub resolves `secrets.X` inside a reusable workflow to the EMPTY STRING when
X is not declared under `on.workflow_call.secrets` -- no warning, no failure, no
log line. The step runs with the variable unset.

That is how the tenant path broke. tenant-bootstrap.yml passed nine credentials
to the Day-0 step -- the registry pair, object storage, and five Grafana Cloud
values -- and declared none of them. A tenant who had set every one of those
repository secrets correctly got a box that could not pull their own images and
silently had no database backups, while the local loop worked because it reads
k8-secrets/ instead.

Three checks, because each fails differently:

  used but not declared      the value silently vanishes (the bug above)
  declared but not forwarded the same vanishing, one level up -- for EVERY
    by a caller              declared secret, optional ones included: an
                             optional credential a caller drops is a box that
                             quietly lacks a capability (the tenant template
                             never forwarded ZITADEL_SMTP_URL, so no box it
                             bootstrapped could send mail)
  forwarded but not declared GitHub refuses the whole run
