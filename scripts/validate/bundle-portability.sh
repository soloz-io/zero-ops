# What a released bundle still fetches from the platform's own repository.
#
# ADR-063 requires a tenant to be able to hold the bundle it runs, and ADR-065
# that revoking the platform's access stops proposals arriving and stops nothing
# running. Both are false for anything a released cluster still reaches into
# this repository for: the bundle would be portable only in appearance, and the
# gap is invisible until the day the repository is not reachable.
#
# Fails rather than reports. ADR-063 makes mirroring a condition of a supported
# runtime, so a bundle that cannot be mirrored cannot be released -- a reference
# left here would make the custody claim untrue for every tenant that received
# the bundle, and the gap stays invisible until the platform is unreachable.

# pipefail alone is not enough: the exit code that matters is the checker's, and
# it is the last stage of the pipe, so `set -e` propagates it.
