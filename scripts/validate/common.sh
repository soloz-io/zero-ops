# Shared harness for the validation modules in preflight/ and cluster/.
#
# Sourced by every module. Modules only call the reporting helpers below and
# never manage counters or exit codes themselves — run.sh owns the aggregate
# result so that a module can be executed standalone during debugging without
# behaving differently from how it behaves inside a bootstrap.

# ─── Severity model ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Validation runs at two moments with different tolerances:
#
#   VALIDATE_MODE=gate   mid-bootstrap. The platform is still converging, so a
#                        resource that has not appeared yet is not a defect.
#   VALIDATE_MODE=final  after bootstrap. Everything must have converged; the
#                        same condition is now a defect.
#
# `soft_fail` encodes exactly that difference, so one module implementation
# serves both moments instead of two copies drifting apart. `hard_fail` is for
# conditions that are wrong regardless of timing (a wrong environment slug is
# not going to converge into the right one).

# The public DNS zone for this environment. prod is un-prefixed (ADR-051); every
# other environment is prefixed. Must stay in lockstep with the --domain-filter
# expression in 03-platform-services-appset.yaml, which is what actually scopes
# what a spoke may write.
# HUB_DOMAIN first: a tenant's box publishes on the tenant's domain, and probing
# the platform's hostnames from it proves nothing about either. The literals
# below are the platform's OWN box, kept as the fallback so running this in this
# checkout needs no arguments -- the same reason the manifests carried them, and
# they were wrong there for the same reason.
#
# ADR-051 makes the base domain the authority every public host derives from, and
# hubDomain is that value: environment-prefixed except in prod, which uses the
# apex. So it is used as-is rather than re-prefixed here.
# ENV_ZONE_SOURCE is carried so the banner can say WHERE the zone came from.
# The literal below is the platform's own, and a check that silently falls back
# to it judges a tenant's box by hostnames it does not own -- which failed a
# correct box with "external-dns --domain-filter is not dev.nutgraf.in" while the
# line above it confirmed the filter was correctly dev.acme.example. The value
# was wrong and nothing said so, because the banner printed a zone either way.
# HUB_DOMAIN, or nothing. There is no default.

# It used to fall back to the PLATFORM's own zone, so every check on a tenant box
# was made against a domain that box does not own. That failed a correct box --
# "external-dns --domain-filter is not dev.nutgraf.in" on a box whose filter was
# correctly dev.acme.example -- and it would equally have PASSED a box misconfigured
# to publish on the platform's zone, which is the worse direction.
#
# Only the cluster modules read ENV_ZONE, and every caller with a cluster can read
# HubEnvironment.spec.domain, which ADR-051 makes the sole authority. A caller that
# cannot is a caller with nothing to check hostnames against, and it is told so

# become ready".

# became true, 1 if it never did.
#
# This exists instead of a sleep between bootstrap and validation, which is the
# obvious thing to reach for and the wrong one. Every check here sampled the
# cluster once, so a component still converging -- a CNPG cluster electing its
# primary, an Application mid-sync -- was reported as a failure, and the run
# died on a box that was seconds from correct.
#
# A blanket sleep would have hidden that, and hidden more besides. It is a guess
# that does not generalise across a cold image cache or a slower node; it adds
# its full cost to runs that were going to fail anyway; and after it, a pass
# means "ready, or we waited long enough" with no way to tell which. This waits
# only as long as it must, fails with the condition named rather than a
# timestamp, and leaves "converging" distinguishable from "broken" -- which is
# the distinction the whole validation surface exists to make.
#
# Use it ONLY for state that converges. A namespace no manifest declares, an
# image reference that 404s, an allowlist that does not match: waiting cannot
# change those answers, and a check that waits on one turns an instant, correct
# failure into a slow one.
