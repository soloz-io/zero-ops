# The Support Agent is one container, and holds no ServiceAccount token.
#
# ADR-077 addendum 4 decision 9. Every seam in this component is a place its
# trustworthiness has to be argued again: a sidecar has its own image, its own
# provenance and its own egress, and none of it appears in the allowlist a tenant
# reviews. One container means one thing to read.
#
# `automountServiceAccountToken: false` is the part most likely to be missed,
# and it is not decorative. Telemeter's ServiceAccount token IS its read
# credential -- assets/telemeter-client/deployment.yaml passes
# --from-token-file=/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token to reach
# the cluster's Prometheus. This agent has no ClusterRole (gate 80), so a mounted
# token grants it nothing today. It is one ClusterRole away from granting
# everything, and the mount is the half a review does not look at.
#
# Checked against the manifests rather than the cluster: the claim is about what
# the platform ships to every box, not about what one hub happens to run.
