# Collection is scoped to platform namespaces, and carries a real cluster identity.
#
# ADR-078 records both of these as live defects in its own Context: Alloy scrapes
# "discovery.kubernetes.pods and discovery.kubernetes.services with no namespace
# filter -- every tenant workload's metrics, forwarded off-cluster -- and stamps
# external_labels = { cluster = "hub" }, a constant, so two clusters arriving at
# one destination are indistinguishable."
#
# The first is a boundary violation under ADR-066 and does not become less true
# because the destination is changing. The second is worse than it looks:
# mislabelled data is being written now and cannot be relabelled later, which is
# why ADR-078 addendum 1 decision 14 sequences both fixes AHEAD of the storage
# build rather than with it.
#
# ADR-078 is Proposed, so this reports as a warning rather than failing the run.
# It becomes a hard failure when ADR-078 is Accepted -- which is the same rule
# architecture-consistency.py applies to a Proposed ADR's acceptance tests, and
# for the same reason: mid-build is allowed, silent mid-build is not.
