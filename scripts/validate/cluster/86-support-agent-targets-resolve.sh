# Every collector's target exists.
#
# ADR-077 addendum 4 decision 13 exists because of a live defect this would have
# caught on the day it was written: the `node-pressure` collector declared
#
#     source: {kind: metrics, namespace: kube-system, service: metrics-server,
#              query: kube_node_status_condition}
#
# and kube_node_status_condition is a kube-state-metrics series. metrics-server's
# own /metrics describes metrics-server. So the one collector ADR-067 names for
# an upgrade pre-flight verdict returned nothing on every box, and said so only
# in the payload's `Skipped` map, which nobody reads until a support case needs
# the evidence that is not there.
#
# A collector that silently collects nothing is worse than one that fails: the
# payload still arrives, still looks complete, and the gap appears as "this box
# has no node pressure" rather than as an error.
#
# This runs against the live cluster because the targets are Services from
# upstream charts, not manifests in this repository -- there is nothing static to
# resolve them against. A non-empty Skipped map at runtime is an ALERT, never a
# release failure (a collector may be legitimately absent on a spoke); this gate
# is the release-time half, and it asks only whether the target exists at all.
