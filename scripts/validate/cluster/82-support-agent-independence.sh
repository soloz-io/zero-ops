# The Support Agent must not read the observability backend.
#
# ADR-078 §8: shared platform evidence sources, independent collection and
# export paths. The agent's collectors name component metrics endpoints
# directly -- the same /metrics surfaces Alloy scrapes -- and never the store
# Alloy writes to.
#
# Gated rather than reviewed, because the coupling is the convenient thing to
# introduce. Once a metrics store exists in the box, pointing the agent at it is
# one line and looks like a simplification. It is not:
#
#   * support telemetry would then depend on a component the tenant may scale
#     down, so a box with observability disabled becomes an unsupported box --
#     the licence check ADR-077 exists to prevent, arriving by a different door;
#   * the store holds whatever the tenant opted in under ADR-078 §7, so the
#     allowlist would be filtering an unbounded payload instead of bounding a
#     known one, which is a preference and not a boundary.
#
# Checked against the shipped allowlist, which is the contract, by a positive
# test: a collector's query must be a bare series name and no collector may name
# the namespace that holds the query surface. See the checker below for why that
# replaced a list of product names.
#
# A module, not a standalone script. run.sh SOURCES each file and then calls the
# validate_* functions it defined, so top-level code here ran in the runner's own
# shell. Three things followed from that, and all three were live:
#
#   * `$1` read the RUNNER's first argument, which is --mode=final. This looked
#     for its allowlist at "--mode=final/manifests/.../allowlist.yaml" and
#     reported it missing -- while the file sat in the repository, present and
#     correct.
#   * a top-level `exit 1` ended the whole validation run, not one check, so a
#     single failure here took every check after it with it.
#   * `set -euo pipefail` changed the runner's shell options for everything that
#     sourced afterwards.

# A POSITIVE test, replacing a list of vendor product names.
#
# The old form matched "victoriametrics", "vmalert", "loki", "thanos" and so on
# as substrings. Two things were wrong with it: it had to anticipate every
# product a store might ever be, and it silently permitted the one nobody
# thought of. Neither is a property you want in the check that holds a boundary.
#
# What ADR-078 §8 actually forbids is reaching a QUERY SURFACE. Two rules say
# that without naming anyone's product:
#
#   1. a collector's query is a bare series name. ADR-077 already requires this
#      -- "collectors run defined queries; they never forward what a response
#      happened to contain" -- and a query API call cannot be written as a bare
#      series name, so the rule enforces the decision rather than restating it.
#   2. no collector names platform-observability, the one namespace in this
#      platform that holds a store and its query surface.
#
# Rule 1 is the load-bearing one. VMSingle serves /metrics and /api/v1/query on
# the same port, so no network policy can separate them and no namespace check
# can either once a collector is inside. What distinguishes reading a component
# from querying a store is the SHAPE OF THE REQUEST, which is what this reads.
