# ADR-087 — Workload Configuration and Secrets: every LIVE-CLUSTER check.
#
# One file per ADR; the number is the ADR's. Static counterparts are in
# preflight/087-workload-configuration-and-secrets.sh.


# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every declared secret is actually present
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ADR-087 requires a declared secret to be verified BEFORE a workload consumes
# it. This is that check, and its value is entirely in WHEN it reports and WHAT
# it says.
#
# The failure it replaces: a key absent from the provider fails the whole
# ExternalSecret, so no Secret is created, so every workload reading it stays in
# CreateContainerConfigError, its Service has no endpoints, and the gateway in
# front answers 503. Nothing in that chain names a secret. It happened on
# 2026-09-02 and again on 2026-09-22, both times surfacing as
# `/api/v1/auth/me` returning `503 ... backends required DNS resolution which
# failed` -- an ingress error for a missing credential.
#
# Read from ESO's own status rather than by querying Infisical directly. ESO has
# already performed the lookup with the credential and scoping the workload will
# actually use, so its verdict is the delivery path itself; a separate query
# would be a second path that can agree while the real one fails.
#
# The report names the CAPABILITY, because that is what an operator can act on.
# "AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY is missing" asks the reader to already know what that is.
