# ADR-078 addendum 5 §5: every cluster's Alertmanager has the credentials it needs,
# and the per-cell one is really there.
#
# Two of the three are copied into each cell by hub-operator
# (ALERT_SMTP_PASSWORD, GRAFANA_IRM_ALERTMANAGER_URL). The third is not and must
# not be: GRAFANA_IRM_HEARTBEAT_URL is one heartbeat integration PER CLUSTER, so
# copying the hub's into every cell would make every cluster's heartbeat land on
# one integration and a dead cluster would look alive.
#
# Nothing on the platform generates it, so the static producer check
# (preflight/95) can only report that it is externally provisioned per cell. That
# is a declaration, not evidence. This is the evidence: the credential is asserted
# on the live cluster, where a cell nobody seeded fails.
#
# The failure it catches is silent by construction. A missing key leaves the
# ExternalSecret not Ready, the Secret absent, and Alertmanager running normally --
# it just never sends a heartbeat. The monitoring system then reports nothing
# wrong, which is indistinguishable from healthy until an incident is missed.
