# A network policy that selects no endpoints is reported Healthy. It is simply
# inert — enforcing nothing, denying nothing, and looking exactly like a policy
# that works.
#
# On 2026-08-31 `agent-sandbox-default-deny` selected pods by a label the SDK
# writes into the Sandbox CR's podTemplate. The agent-sandbox controller owns
# that label space and replaces it, so the label never reached a pod: the
# policy governed ZERO pods and the "no cluster-internal access" its own header
# describes had never once been in force. Nothing reported it, because a CCNP
# selecting nothing is not an error.
#
# The same shape appeared twice more that day — a certificate authority that
# existed but could not issue, and toFQDNs rules matching no address. The common
# property is a component reporting healthy while doing nothing, which is the
# class this check exists to break.
#
# Scoped to policies the PLATFORM owns. A tenant policy may legitimately select
# nothing while its workload is scaled to zero, and failing on that would train
# people to ignore this check.
