# Every tenant's OAuth clients exist IN THE ISSUER (ADR-060).
#
# This replaces the hydra-maester gate. That one read a CR's status, because a
# controller reconciled clients into Hydra and could fail silently. Zitadel has
# no such controller: the Tenant Identity Service creates clients through the
# issuer's API. So the failure mode moved rather than disappearing — the service
# can report success and publish a client id whose application was later deleted,
# renamed, or created in the wrong organisation, and nothing in the cluster goes
# unhealthy. The only symptom is a login that fails in the browser.
#
# So the assertion is deliberately end-to-end and against the issuer itself:
#
#   Infisical holds a client id for the tenant   (the platform published it)
#     ∧ Zitadel holds an application with that exact client id
#     ∧ it lives in the tenant's own organisation
#
# Credentials come from the Infisical API rather than from the projected Secret,
# and that is the point: reading the Secret would only prove ESO copied
# something. Reading the source of truth proves the value the platform published
# is the value the issuer knows, which is what a login actually depends on.
#
# Infisical connection details come from the ADR-045 bootstrap-generated
# artifacts committed in Git — the same values the platform itself runs on, so
# this cannot drift from what it is validating.

# Local port for a port-forward, echoed on stdout. Ports are chosen by the
# kernel (":0") because a fixed one collides with whatever else the operator is
# running, and the failure then looks like an unreachable service.
