# Failing to report must not affect anything else.
#
# ADR-077 states this as the most important runtime invariant after the RBAC one,
# and names the ways it erodes: "a readiness probe wired to upload success, a
# sidecar that blocks a pod's start, an init container that waits for enrolment,
# a controller that treats a transmission error as a reconcile failure."
#
# Each of those is a small change that makes the platform's OPERATION depend on
# the platform's COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP, which is the thing this architecture
# exists not to do. None of them would be described that way in the commit that
# added it.
#
# The agent therefore declares no probe at all. That is stronger than "no probe
# wired to upload success" and it is checkable without reading the probe's
# meaning: an agent with no probe cannot have one that reports the support
# endpoint's health as the pod's health. It costs nothing -- the agent serves no
# traffic, so nothing needs to know when it is ready.
