# Backups for every CNPG cluster in the fleet — hub platform-db AND the spoke's
# shared-cnpg.
#
# On 2026-09-02 BOTH had run their entire lives without a single successful
# backup while reporting "Cluster in healthy state". platform-db holds Infisical:
# the PKI root and every platform secret, on local-path, one node's disk.
#
# The old check looked only at lastSuccessfulBackup, only on the hub. That is the
# LAGGING indicator and it misses two things:
#
#   1. The spoke entirely. shared-cnpg was broken the same way and nothing looked.
#   2. Timing. Backups are scheduled daily at 01:00, so a cluster validated
#      minutes after creation legitimately has no backup yet. The field is empty
#      whether backups are healthy-but-pending or permanently broken, so it
#      cannot fail a fresh cluster — which is exactly when this must be caught.
#
# ContinuousArchiving is the LEADING indicator. It goes False within seconds of
# the first WAL and stays there. Both real failures were visible in it hours
# before any backup was due, and NEITHER self-healed:
#
#   failed to get envs: cache miss
#       The instance manager caches barman credentials ONCE, at instance
#       reconcile. If the S3 secret is not there at that moment it never retries,
#       so the database runs healthy and archives nothing, forever.
#
#   WAL archive check failed for server <name>: Expected empty archive
#       serverName still points at a previous incarnation's WALs after a rebuild
#       from initdb. barman refuses to interleave two databases under one server
#       name, and CNPG blocks every base backup behind the failing archive.
#
# Because neither converges, these are hard failures in gate mode too.

# Assert one CNPG cluster's backup posture.
