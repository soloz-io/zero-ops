# Nothing reaches inward to the Support Agent.
#
# ADR-077: no platform component opens a connection into a tenant's cluster,
# holds a credential for one, or queries it. The agent is the one component that
# talks to the platform at all, so if anything were ever going to grow an inbound
# path it would be this one.
#
# Checked as a property of the manifests rather than of the agent's code. A
# process that never listens is a process that might listen after the next
# change; a component with no Service, no Ingress and no ingress rule cannot be
# reached however its code behaves. That is the difference between a boundary and
# an intention.
#
# Three things are asserted, because each can be defeated without the others:
#
#   1. the NetworkPolicy declares the Ingress policyType, so the default is deny
#   2. it carries no ingress RULES -- `ingress: []` is fine, an entry is not
#   3. the component ships no Service, Ingress, HTTPRoute or Gateway at all
#
# Check 3 is not redundant. A Service with no NetworkPolicy permitting it is
# unreachable today and reachable the moment someone relaxes the policy for an
# unrelated reason, and the review that relaxes it will not be looking for a
# Service nobody remembers adding.
#
# A module, not a standalone script -- see 82 for the same defect and why it
# matters: run.sh sources these, so `$1` was the runner's --mode=final, a
# top-level `exit 1` ended the whole run, and `set -euo pipefail` leaked into the
# runner's shell.
