# ADR-078 addendum 2 §15, addendum 5: the collection floor is accepted on
# end-to-end evidence, never on a green sync. LIVE checks, read-only, against each
# cluster's OWN stores -- where its dashboards and rules read.
#
#   C1  each expected job has targets for this cluster, and every target is up
#   C2  node-local jobs (kubelet, cadvisor, node-exporter) have one up target
#       per node -- a node with no agent is a node nobody is watching
#   C3  a known series from each job is queryable
#   C4  that series carries the cluster's own `cluster` label (the agent's
#       configured identity), never empty and never a placeholder
#   C5  this cluster's pod logs are queryable in its Loki
#   C6  this cluster's platform rules are loaded by its platform VMAlert
#   C7  both VMSingles hold this cluster's series (addendum 5 §3: every sample
#       is written to both)
#
# Every query goes through `kubectl port-forward` with the kubeconfig's own
# identity: no credential of its own, nothing published. Not the API server's
# service proxy: the API server dials pod IPs from the control-plane host, which
# the namespace's default-deny (addendum 1 §9) rightly refuses. A port-forward
# reaches the pod through its kubelet, as an operator would.
