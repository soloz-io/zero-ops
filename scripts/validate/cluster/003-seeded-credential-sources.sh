# ADR-003: a seeded credential's SOURCE Secret carries every key the uploader reads.
#
# Bootstrap Secrets are seeded once, at Day-0: hub-bootstrap step 6b writes
# k8-secrets/<subdir>/<file> into a cluster Secret, hub-operator's CLISecretMappings
# publishes that Secret to Infisical, and ESO delivers it back out. Only the last two
# hops reconcile. Nothing watches k8-secrets/ -- it is a directory on the operator's
# machine, reachable from no cluster -- so a credential added there AFTER the box was
# built never arrives, and the box keeps running on whatever it was seeded with.
#
# That drift is quiet. The uploader skips a source Secret that does not exist, so a
# credential absent from this box is not a failure; but a Secret that EXISTS and is
# missing a key fails every reconcile with "source secret missing key <k>", the
# summary drops to "17 of 19", and nothing else changes. Observed on the hub,
# 2026-10-30: platform-ops/grafana-cloud still held the retired Grafana Cloud metrics
# keys and neither IRM URL, two uploads had been failing on every reconcile for days,
# and alerting kept working because the values had reached Infisical by another route.
#
# The check is the same question the uploader asks, asked before anyone reads a log.
# Declarations come from the operator source, so a mapping added without its seed is
# caught by the same rule rather than by a list maintained here.
