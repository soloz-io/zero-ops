# ADR-109: the Credit Authority's isolation and guarantees, LIVE. The rendered
# half is preflight/109-credit-authority-isolation.sh; both gate the capability.
#
# The Credit Authority runs on the HUB (platform-credits) and is reached only
# through the hub Gateway at credits.<hubDomain>. Read-only: every probe is a
# connection attempt from a pod that already runs, and changes nothing.
#
#   X1  it is Ready and its provisioner exited 0
#   X2  the ledger is bound to 127.0.0.1, 3000 is the pod's only port and the
#       Service's only port, and the pod is not on the host network
#   X3  ingress is the hub Gateway's identity only, on 3000, and the route
#       reaches the gateway and nothing else
#   X4  the admitted caller is the declaring application's own service client,
#       and its organisation that application's -- the binding traces to the one
#       declaration
#   X5  nothing in its namespace grants pods/exec or pods/portforward, and no
#       service account outside the platform's own controllers can do either in
#       it -- asked of the API server, so cluster-wide bindings count: either
#       reaches the ledger's loopback past the gateway
#   X6  from another hub namespace: the ledger's port and the gateway's port on
#       the pod's address do not connect (loopback; Gateway identity only); from
#       the declaring application's SDK on its spoke, credits.<hubDomain>
#       answers through the Gateway
#   X7  with every token below set, the guarantees and isolation suites
#       (test/e2e/credit-authority) pass through credits.<hubDomain>:
#         CREDITS_TOKEN               the declaring application's machine token
#         CREDITS_ID_TOKEN            an ID token from a real login
#         CREDITS_OTHER_APP_TOKEN     another application's machine token
#         CREDITS_OTHER_TENANT_TOKEN  a token carrying another organisation's claim
#         CREDITS_EXPIRED_TOKEN       an expired token of the declaring application
#       A missing token, or any test that skips, is a failure to prove, not a
#       pass. The guarantees suite covers atomicity, concurrent spends,
#       idempotency and the refused opt-outs of the balance check.
#
# ACTIVATION EVIDENCE. X7 writes its record -- when, where, the deployed image
# digests, the admitted caller and every test's verdict -- to
# docs/evidence/109-credit-authority/, passed or not. The capability is
# activated only on a record whose X7 passed (ADR-109 §7).

# The platform's own controllers, which hold cluster-wide rights by design and
# are the "platform operators" ADR-109 §4 names. Anything else able to exec
# into or port-forward to the Credit Authority fails X5.
