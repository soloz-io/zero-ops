# ADR-050 (Amendment 2026-10-21): an unauthenticated API call gets 401, never a
# login redirect. LIVE checks, read-only, against every public application host.
#
#   A1  a sessionless request a page makes itself (Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors) gets
#       401 and sets NO cookie. A 302 here is the v1.5.0 defect: the page's fetch
#       follows it cross-origin into CORS, the app never sees a 401, and every
#       such call leaves a ~500-byte login-transaction cookie until the next real
#       login fails at /oauth/callback with "Request Header Or Cookie Too Large".
#   A2  a sessionless document navigation still gets 302 into the login flow.
#
# Hosts are read from the platform's public routes (tenant-public-tls), so every
# publicly reachable application is covered without naming one. Only hosts whose
# gateway runs the login policy are checked: an app with gateway.oidc.enabled
# false (a public site) has no login for this contract to govern.
