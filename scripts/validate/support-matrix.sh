# Assert the whole support matrix, not only the half that works.
#
# Every environment crossed with every provider is evaluated. A combination the
# chart declares supported must render and must publish every chart it names. A
# combination it does not declare must be refused, by name, with a reason.
#
# Asserting both halves is what stops the matrix drifting. Checking only that
# supported combinations render would let someone add prod+hybrid to
# supportedMatrix, see the release stay green because nothing tests the
# combinations that are meant to fail, and believe it supported -- while the
# sources behind it do not exist. Checking only that unsupported ones fail would
# let a supported combination quietly stop rendering.
