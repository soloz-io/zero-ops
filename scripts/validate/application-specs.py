"""Fail a release whose bundle generates Applications that cannot be deployed.

Rendering successfully is not the same as being deployable, and three defects
reached published releases through exactly that gap: Applications naming charts
no release published, a chart carrying one cluster's Infisical project IDs, and
an Application naming a Helm chart and a Kustomize block together -- which
ArgoCD refuses with "multiple application sources defined" and which no gate
noticed because the chart itself rendered.

Every ApplicationSet a bundle generates is expanded into the Applications it
would create, and each is checked as a spec rather than as text:

  1. source types are mutually exclusive     -- ArgoCD permits one per source
  2. the chart it names is published         -- a reference to nothing
  3. it resolves to at least one object      -- Healthy while managing nothing
  4. no runtime dependency on platform git   -- ADR-063 custody
  5. it renders for the topology given       -- variants must resolve
  6. the spec is structurally valid          -- required fields, shapes

Reads the released render on stdin.

Usage: helm template ... | application-specs.py <chart-dir> [<chart-dir> ...]
