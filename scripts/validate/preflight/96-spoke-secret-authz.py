"""Resolve every spoke ExternalSecret's effective remoteRef.key and assert it lands
inside the cell's ADR-031 prefix.

Kept as a real file rather than a heredoc: the logic parses YAML that itself contains
quotes and Go-template braces, and embedding it in `$(... <<'PY' ...)` has already
produced two separate bash parsing failures.

Emits tab-separated lines the shell wrapper classifies:
    OK<TAB><message>
    BAD<TAB><name><TAB><message>
    NONE                     (nothing rendered)

# These are real ADR-031 violations: the cell Machine Identity cannot read a root
# path, so they will fail even after the spoke store is healthy. They are NOT fixed
# here because the fix is a producer change — something must write the value to
# /spoke-pool/<cell>/shared/ — and the ownership/generation contract for that is a
# deliberate architecture decision, not a path rewrite.

#       already per-cell BY NAME, at the root. hub-operator generates it
#       (EnsureCrossplaneAdminPassword); moving it under the cell prefix is a
#       producer-side change.
#   hetzner-dns-credentials       hcloud-token
#       fleet-constant. Per the Grafana Cloud precedent it should be materialised
#       into each cell path rather than read from a shared root.

# Remove an entry the moment its producer writes the cell-scoped path. The list
