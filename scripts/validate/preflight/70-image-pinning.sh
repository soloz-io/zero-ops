# Floating tags make a cluster non-reproducible: `:latest` resolves at pull time,
# so a pod reschedule can silently land on a different build than its neighbours.
# This is not hypothetical here — the argocd-agent `latest` in use was rebuilt
# upstream nightly, with no version label in the image config to even identify it.
#
# The check runs against RENDERED output, not source text. A kubebuilder scaffold
# leaves `image: controller:latest` in manager.yaml and overrides it from
# kustomization.yaml, so the source line is a false positive while the shipped
# manifest is correctly digest-pinned. Rendering is the only way to tell the two
# apart, and rendered output is what actually reaches the cluster.
