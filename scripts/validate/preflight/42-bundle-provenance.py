"""A published bundle must say which source produced it.

0.1.16-rc.29 was published, pulled by a cluster, and carried exactly one fact
about itself:

    version: 0.1.16-rc.29

No commit, no branch, no indication that it was built from a working tree with
uncommitted changes -- which it was. "What is in rc.29?" had no answer that did
not depend on someone remembering, and none of it was written down.

Both callers of publish.sh build from a working tree: the release workflow from
a checkout, a developer from a laptop (that is the local release path, and it is
deliberate). So the dirty case cannot be refused without breaking the workflow
this supports. It is recorded instead, and this asserts the recording exists.

Checks the generator, not a built artefact, because the artefact only exists
during a publish and this has to fail before one happens.
