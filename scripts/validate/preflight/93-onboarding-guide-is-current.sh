# The product-team onboarding guide names things that still exist.
#
# docs/onboarding-an-application.md is the one document a product team reads
# before touching the platform, and it was the one document nothing verified. An
# ADR gets read when its subject changes; a guide just ages, until someone
# follows it and fails at a step the platform stopped supporting.
#
# Scope, stated precisely: this asserts that everything the guide NAMES still
# exists -- labels the admission policy requires, values keys the chart or XRD
# defines, ADRs, soloz commands, exported library functions. It does not assert
# the guide is COMPLETE, because completeness is a judgement and this is a gate.
# A platform capability added without documenting it passes here, deliberately.
#
# Each check has been shown to fail against injected drift; a check that has only
# ever passed is not evidence of anything.
