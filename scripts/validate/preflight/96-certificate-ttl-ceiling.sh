# A certificate profile's TTL is a server-side CEILING. Requesting more than the
# ceiling does not fail when the Certificate is applied — cert-manager accepts it,
# the issuer refuses or truncates at signing time, and the damage appears at the
# FIRST RENEWAL, one full certificate lifetime later. For a 7-day certificate that
# is a week; for the 90-day ones this replaced, it was a quarter.
#
# That delay is the whole problem: whoever changes a duration or a ceiling gets no
# feedback, and the failure surfaces as unexplained mTLS breakage long after.
#
# So: every Certificate issued through an infisical issuer must request no more than
# its profile allows. Ceilings are read from internal/pki, the single authoritative
# registry (ADR-035 addendum §2), and the issuer→profile mapping from the
# ClusterIssuer manifests, so this check follows both as they change.
