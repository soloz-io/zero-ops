"""The product-team onboarding guide names things that still exist.

docs/onboarding-an-application.md tells a product team what to declare, what
labels to carry, which commands to run and which library functions to call. It is
the one document a team reads before touching the platform, and it is the one
document nothing verifies -- an ADR at least gets read when its subject changes,
while a guide simply ages until someone follows it and fails.

The failure mode is specific and expensive: a guide that names a field the chart
no longer reads, or a label the policy no longer requires, sends a team to debug
their own work. Every check here is therefore "does the thing the guide names
still exist", never "is the guide complete" -- completeness is a judgement and
this is a gate.

Checked:
    A  every label the tenant ABI policy REQUIRES is named in the guide
    B  every values key the guide shows is a real key somewhere
    C  every ADR the guide cites exists
    D  every `soloz` command the guide shows is registered
    E  every zero-ops-auth function the guide shows is exported

Emits tab-separated lines the shell wrapper classifies:
    OK<TAB><message>
    BAD<TAB><message>
    NONE
