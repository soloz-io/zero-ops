# ADR-047 addendum: a platform manifest or binary must not name a tenant.
#
# Tenant runtime state lives in fleet-registry (ADR-004), and the platform renders
# tenant resources parameterised by fleetId. A literal tenant name in platform code
# inverts that: the platform starts depending on something that only exists after
# onboarding.
#
# That is not cosmetic. waypoint-bff-client-secret is an ExternalSecret in
# platform-edge whose key is only produced once that tenant's OAuth client is
# registered — so on a fresh hub, where no tenant has onboarded, it can never
# resolve. It was the single ExternalSecret still failing at 21/22 after every other
# secret converged, and it fails that way on every rebuild. It was repeatedly
# mistaken for a seeding gap; the dependency simply should not exist yet.
#
# The known offenders are baselined so the rule is enforceable today without
# blocking on the refactor. Anything NEW fails: a tenth file, or a second tenant
# hardcoded the same way.

# Tenant identifiers observed in this repo. There is no canonical local list —
# tenants live in fleet-registry — so this enumerates the names that have actually
# leaked. The rule is "no tenant names at all"; this is how it is detected.
#
# `nutgraf` IS THE TENANT. `waypoint` and `oranger` are its APPLICATIONS (ADR-088
# keeps those axes separate), and for a long time this list held only the two
# application names -- so the check was called "tenant identifiers" while being
# unable to see a single tenant name. The rule applies to both axes for the same
# reason: the platform renders them parameterised, and naming either makes platform
# code depend on something that exists only after onboarding.

# `nutgraf.in` IS NOT COUNTED, AND THAT IS A DEFERRAL, NOT AN EXEMPTION.
#
# It appears 345 times, as two different things: the DNS domain every environment
# is served on (api., auth., console., dev., stg.) and the API GROUP of every
# platform CRD -- ops.nutgraf.in, billing.nutgraf.in, compute.nutgraf.in,
# spokepools.nutgraf.in, tenantdatabases.nutgraf.in.
#
# The API groups are a real leak and a worse one than anything this check catches:
# the platform ships to a customer's own box (BYOC), so a SOLOZ platform installed
# for another customer would serve CRDs named after this tenant. But renaming an
# API group rewrites every CRD, every RBAC rule, every manifest that references
# one, and every object already stored in etcd under the old group. That is a
# migration with its own decision to make, not something a validation script
# should force by failing the build today.
#
# So it is excluded HERE and recorded as open. If it were simply matched, this
# check would fail 130 files and be switched off, which is the outcome that loses
# the rule entirely.
# Both spellings: controller-gen derives webhook paths from the API group, so
# `nutgraf.in` arrives as `nutgraf-in` in /mutate-nutgraf-in-v1alpha1-spokepool.
# Same leak, same deferral; subtracting only the dotted form missed it.

# tenant's OAuth clients, and its Deployment no longer mounts a tenant secret.

# EMPTY as of 2026-09-02. Both former entries are remediated: d3b7303d moved
# AgentGateway to one instance per tenant configured from the fleet registry, so

# fleet-parameterised. What each still contains is a tenant name in a COMMENT,
