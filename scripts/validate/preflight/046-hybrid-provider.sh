# ADR-046 — Hybrid Provider / Home Worker: every STATIC check, in one file.
#
# One file per ADR. Before this, ADR-046's checks were spread across four
# preflight modules numbered by running order -- 15, 25, 26, 85 -- so "what
# validates ADR-046?" was a grep rather than a listing, and a decision added to
# the ADR had no obvious home. The number is now the ADR's, which makes the
# mapping mechanical in both directions:
#
#   ls scripts/validate/*/046-*        every check for this ADR
#   head -1 <file>                     the ADR a check belongs to
#
# Merging is safe and does not change behaviour: run.sh SOURCES every module
# into one shell and then runs each `validate_*` function it finds, so four
# sourced files and one concatenated file are the same program. Ordering is
# presentational -- nothing exits early, failures are collected and reported at
# the end.
#
# Live counterparts are in cluster/046-hybrid-provider.sh. The split is the
# runner's phase boundary (static vs. a real cluster), not a second taxonomy.
#
# Sections below carry the ADR section they enforce.


# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# §23 — Hetzner project capacity
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Hetzner project capacity, checked before anything is created (ADR-046 §23).
#
# A hub consumes one load balancer for its control plane, plus one more for every
# `type: LoadBalancer` Service still in the platform. Each spoke consumes another.
# The project ceiling is small and shared by every cluster in the account, so a run
# can be refused by resources that belong to a cluster nobody is looking at.
#
# When the ceiling is hit CAPH reports LoadBalancerCreateFailed on the HetznerCluster
# and the CAPI Cluster stays at Provisioning forever. That is indistinguishable from
# a slow provision unless you read the condition reason, which is why on 2026-08-23
# it was polled to timeout and diagnosed only from a live cluster.
#
# The zero-target detector below is the part that earns its place. A CCM-created
# load balancer is named a<service-uid> and carries exactly one label,
# hcloud-ccm/service-uid — nothing that ties it to a cluster. Teardown could not
# match it, and the CCM that alone could delete it dies with the cluster. Four such
# accumulated silently over four rebuilds and reported nothing wrong anywhere until
# they blocked the *next* provision.
#
# A CCM load balancer with no targets is one of two defects, and preflight runs
# without a cluster so it cannot tell them apart — deliberately, because both need
# action and neither is visible from inside Kubernetes:
#
#   leaked  — its Service is gone with a destroyed cluster. Delete it; it consumes
#             quota and is billed forever.
#   broken  — its Service is live but the CCM registered no backends, so the load
#             balancer accepts TCP and forwards nothing. Deleting it achieves
#             nothing; the CCM recreates it. Fix the cause (addendum 2: kubeadm's
#             exclude-from-external-load-balancers label on the control plane, and
#             home workers whose unmanaged:// providerID the CCM cannot target).
#
# Once §23 items 1–2 land, no platform Service creates a CCM load balancer at all
# and only the leaked case can occur.

# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Cilium must be able to reach the API server on a cold boot (ADR-046 §24).
#
# The failure this encodes: the shared ClusterClass deletes kube-proxy right after
# `kubeadm init`, because its REJECT chains for endpoint-less services break Gateway
# API under Cilium's full kube-proxy-replacement. Cilium is the intended replacement
# — but with no `k8s-service-host` it discovers the API server through the in-cluster
# ClusterIP (10.96.0.1), the address kube-proxy used to route and that Cilium has not
# yet programmed. A fresh spoke deadlocks: the `config` init container times out, the
# CNI never initialises, the node stays NotReady, and every workload sits Pending.
#
# It stayed latent for weeks because the kube-proxy deletion was applied to a RUNNING
# spoke, where Cilium was already up and deleting kube-proxy is harmless. Only a cold
# boot reproduces it, and ADR-046 §17.3 made spokes reprovision-only — so the first
# cold boot after that change is where it fired. Nothing static caught it, which is
# why this check is static.
#
# The invariant, in one line: if kube-proxy is deleted and Cilium is the replacement,
# something must supply the API endpoint before the first node boots.

# ─── §6, §11, §14 — the datapath invariants a chart upgrade must not reset ────
#
# Every value below is a DECISION with an incident behind it, and none of them
# is asserted anywhere else. That mattered the moment a Cilium upgrade was
# scoped: the settings live in cilium-config-base.yaml and a re-render from
# stock values silently restores the chart's defaults. Nothing fails, nodes go
# Ready, and the datapath breaks in ways that look like something else --
#
#   mtu 1200          ADR-046 §6/§14. 1200 inner + 50B VXLAN = 1250B, inside
#                     tailscale0's 1280. The stock overlay MTU produced ~1308B
#                     outer packets, which fragmented and were dropped by the
#                     BPF datapath as "First logical datagram fragment not
#                     found" -- traffic that works until a payload crosses the
#                     threshold.
#   routing-mode      §14. Native routing was tried and abandoned: it needed
#   tunnel/vxlan      Tailscale subnet-route advertisement, whose table-52
#                     entries shadowed Cilium's own routes (§17.1), and it put
#                     Envoy's return path into a cil_from_netdev/cilium_host
#                     loop that timed out as HTTP 503.
#   auto-direct-      §14, §17.1. These are NATIVE-routing settings. Re-enabling
#   node-routes       either one reintroduces the stale-route collision class
#   direct-routing-   that tunnel mode exists to remove, which is why the
#   device            assertion is that they stay off rather than that they
#                     hold some value.
#
# Asserted per provider, because the providers genuinely differ: the
# hostNetwork Gateway and its Envoy settings are hybrid-only (§8, §15), and
# flattening them into one expectation would either pass on hetzner for the
