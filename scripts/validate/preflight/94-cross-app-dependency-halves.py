"""Every cross-application dependency must be declared by BOTH sides.

ADR-088's amendment introduced the declaration and named this gap explicitly:

    "It does not discover dependencies, and it does not verify that the callee
     agreed: a dependsOn naming an app whose chart declares no matching ingress
     renders a valid policy and a call that hangs."

This is that verification. A caller declaring `identity.backendDependencies:
[waypoint]` gets egress and an audience scope; the target declaring
`identity.allowedConsumers: [oranger]` gets ingress and admits the caller's azp.
Either alone is a half-built path, and the two failure shapes are both quiet:

  caller declares, target does not
      egress opens, ingress does not. Cilium DROPS denied ingress without an RST
      (ADR-046 section 30), so the call HANGS to its timeout rather than being
      refused. The token is minted correctly, the receiver is healthy, and
      nothing in either application reports a policy.

  target declares, caller does not
      the target admits a caller that never arrives, and the platform renders no
      audience scope for it -- so the day someone adds the calling code, the
      exchange fails with invalid_target naming an audience rather than a missing
      declaration.

Checked against the tenant GitOps repository, where both halves are declared.

Emits tab-separated lines the shell wrapper classifies:
