"""ADR-076's escrow list and the implementation must name the same artefacts.

WHY THIS EXISTS

The escrow holds what a box cannot be rebuilt without. ADR-076 enumerates it, and
that enumeration is the only place the set is written down -- the implementation
names each artefact at the call site that backs it up, so the set exists nowhere as
a set.

Which makes the failure shape unusually bad. An artefact that BELONGS in the escrow
and is not backed up produces no error, no warning and no difference in behaviour.
A box bootstraps, runs and behaves identically for its whole life. The absence
surfaces on the day the cluster is gone -- and on that day the escrow cannot be
added retroactively, which is the exact reasoning ADR-076 gives for the escrow
being mandatory rather than opt-in.

So the list is checked against the code instead of trusted. Both directions:

  in the ADR, not in the code     an artefact the ADR promises and nothing backs up.
                                  This is the dangerous direction. zitadel-masterkey
                                  is this today, deliberately and recorded as such.

  in the code, not in the ADR     an artefact being escrowed that the list does not
                                  mention. Less dangerous and still wrong: a
                                  recovery runs from the list, so an artefact
                                  nobody knows exists is one nobody restores.
