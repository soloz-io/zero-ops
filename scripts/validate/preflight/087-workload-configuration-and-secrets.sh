# ADR-087 — Workload Configuration and Secrets: every STATIC check, in one file.
#
# One file per ADR; the number is the ADR's.
#
#   ls scripts/validate/*/087-*        every check for this ADR
#   head -1 <file>                     the ADR a check belongs to
#
# The live counterpart -- "is every declared secret actually present in the
# provider" -- is in cluster/087-workload-configuration-and-secrets.sh, because
# it needs a credential and a reachable Infisical. What can be decided from the
# repository alone is decided here.


# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The declaration itself must be well-formed
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ADR-087 makes the fleet's values.yaml the single statement of what its
# workloads read. That only holds if the statement is complete, so the three
# things the ADR requires of every entry are asserted here rather than left to
# the Helm template -- which catches them too, but only when something renders,
# and by then the fleet is mid-sync.
#
# What is NOT checked here is presence of the value. A declared secret whose
# value is absent is a live-cluster fact and belongs in the cluster module; a
# declaration that could never work is a repository fact and belongs here.
