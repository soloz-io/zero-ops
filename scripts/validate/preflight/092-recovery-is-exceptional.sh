# ADR-092: a deployable steady-state provider manifest must not declare
# spec.bootstrap.recovery.
#
# CloudNativePG reads spec.bootstrap ONCE, at creation. Restoring a backup IS the
# creation of a new cluster, so a restore is a manifest transition plus a
# delete/recreate -- and between entering recovery and settling back, the
# repository holds a manifest that DESTROYS DATA if it is applied: a rebuild in
# that window restores the old incarnation and silently discards everything
# written since.
#
# On 2026-09-25 shared-cnpg was restored and never settled. The window stayed open
# for THREE DAYS and closed only because someone happened to look. A rebuild in it
# would have lost the ADR-090 role migration, a second tenant's entire database,
# and every workflow row the first tenant had written.
#
# The bump script warned about this already -- "settle is not optional
# bookkeeping" -- and opens with "A comment is not a mechanism", written about the
# serverName suffix, which got one. Settle did not. This is the mechanism.
#
# IT DOES NOT SETTLE THE MANIFEST. Whether a restore actually succeeded is a
# judgement about the data, not about the YAML, and auto-settling would make the
# dangerous state vanish without anyone deciding it was safe.
#
# IT PARSES, IT DOES NOT GREP. A search for "recovery:" is defeated by ordering,
# comments and unrelated keys of the same name, and it fires on documentation.
# Runbooks and ADRs must stay free to show a recovery stanza -- that is how the
# procedure is documented -- so only manifests a spoke actually renders are in
# scope.
