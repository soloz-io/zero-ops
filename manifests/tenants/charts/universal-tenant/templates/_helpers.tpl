The two axes, in one place (ADR-088).

`tenantId` is the organisation whose box this is. `appId` is a product running
on it. They were one field until 2026-09-24, which meant the platform could not
tell two products of one customer from two customers -- and resolved that, when
it came up, by putting one product in the other's namespace.

Neither defaults to the other. A chart rendered without `appId` fails here
rather than silently reproducing the collapse it replaces: an appId that falls
back to tenantId is exactly the old model wearing the new field's name.

Where this app's secret material lives (ADR-031 cell scoping, ADR-087 layout).

  /spoke-pool/<cell>/tenants/<app>/KEY

The segment is the APP, and always has been: before ADR-088 the field feeding it
was called tenantId but held a product. So the CONTENT of this path was already
right and only its label was wrong.

ADR-088 first moved it to /tenants/<tenant>/apps/<app>/, which reads correctly
and requires every existing key to be copied to a new location. That is a data
migration bought for a naming improvement, and it was the riskiest step in a
change that otherwise only renames identifiers -- an ExternalSecret fails as a
WHOLE object (ADR-087), so a partial copy withholds unrelated keys from
unrelated workloads.

Deferred deliberately. The path is corrected on its own, when moving it is the
only thing that can go wrong, rather than on the day the namespaces change too.

{{/*
The postgres role an app's database credential authenticates as.

THE ONLY PLACE THIS NAME IS BUILT. Every consumer -- the Role that creates it,
the database it owns, the DefaultPrivileges granted on it, the role it is a
member of, and the username templated into both ExternalSecrets -- reads
spec.dbRoleName from the XR. Before this it was rebuilt at six patch sites in the
composition and once more in the hub operator, and the operator built it on a
different axis (tenantId, not appId), so the credential named a role that did not
exist. Nothing compared the two: the only symptom was

  psql: FATAL: password authentication failed for user "tenant-<tenant>-user"

logged by the baseline migration Job, whose visible effect was a fleet with no
users table.

'_' IS A STRUCTURAL DELIMITER, NOT A STYLE CHOICE. A postgres role is
CLUSTER-WIDE -- pg_authid and pg_auth_members are shared catalogs, so two
databases in one cluster cannot hold distinct roles of the same name -- and one
spoke serves several tenants (ADR-051). The name must therefore be injective over
(tenantId, appId). Delimiting with '-' is NOT: '-' is legal inside both
components, so ("foo", "bar-baz") and ("foo-bar", "baz") both render
"foo-bar-baz", and the two tenants would have been handed a single role that owns
both their databases. '_' is forbidden by the identifier grammar
(^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$, enforced by the API server), so a name built
with it has exactly one parse.

LENGTH IS A CORRECTNESS PROPERTY. postgres truncates an identifier longer than 63
BYTES to 63 with a NOTICE and then succeeds, so two apps sharing a 51-byte prefix
would collide by truncation -- reintroducing exactly what the delimiter prevents.
The fixed parts cost 14 bytes -- the bound follows the LONGEST generated role,
tenant_<tenantId>_<appId>_owner (ADR-093), not the shorter _user -- leaving 49 for
the two components together; the
grammar admits only single-byte ASCII, so characters are bytes and the bound is
exact. Both XRDs carry it as a CEL rule, and this fails first with a message that
names the two lengths.
*/}}
{{/*
The postgres role that OWNS an app's database objects and runs its migrations.

SEPARATE FROM THE RUNTIME ROLE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT (ADR-093).

PostgreSQL exempts a table's OWNER from its own row-level security policies. While
the application connected as the owner, every policy the tenant baseline ships was
inert -- measured on a live spoke, a query as the app's own role with no claims set
returned every row where the policy would have matched none. Setting the RLS
context correctly (ADR-057) changed nothing, because the policies were never
evaluated.

So the migration Job connects as THIS role, which owns what it creates, and the
application connects as universal-tenant.dbRoleName, which owns nothing and holds
DML through DefaultPrivileges -- and is therefore subject to the policies.

THIS IS AN OWNER CREDENTIAL. It can perform any DDL and ownership operation in the
tenant's database. Only the baseline migration Job carries it; a workload that
mounts it is back to the state ADR-093 exists to remove, and silently so.

Composed here, once, for the same reason dbRoleName is: two names that must agree
with what the composition creates, rebuilt at neither of their consumers.

DEPRECATED 2026-10-01 (ADR-099). The owner role is no longer created: the platform
provisions a database and a role and puts nothing inside the database, so there is
nothing for a second role to own. The value is still emitted onto the XR because
the field is still present on both XRDs -- optional and ignored -- and removing the
two together is one change too many for one release. When the property goes, so
does this helper, and the role-length budget it drives loosens with it.
