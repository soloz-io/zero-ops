# <TENANT_ID>-gitops

Infrastructure for the **<TENANT_ID>** box. This repository is yours: it lives in
your organisation, your control plane reconciles it, and your cloud account holds
everything it describes.

## Layout

    clusters/<name>/bundle.yaml              the platform version this cluster runs
    clusters/<name>/values.yaml              your configuration for it
    environments/<env>/values.yaml           what this fleet is: cell, quotas, hostnames
    environments/<env>/<app>/                the version of one application it runs
    templates/workload-cluster/                 render this to add a cluster
    templates/fleet/                         render this to add a fleet
    templates/workload/                      render this to run an application

## Who writes what

The platform proposes changes to `bundle.yaml` as pull requests, in the manner of
a dependency-update bot. It never writes `values.yaml`, and it cannot merge its
own proposal.

You write `values.yaml`. It holds only what differs from the bundle's defaults,
so a default can change in a new version without touching anything here, and an
override you have made survives across versions.

The two are separate files so the two writers never conflict. Merging a proposal
is a normal review; accepting them automatically is a repository setting and
changes nothing about what the platform may do.

## Adding a cluster

Copy `templates/workload-cluster/` to `clusters/<name>/`, replace the tokens, commit.
Your control plane provisions it.

## Running an application

A fleet first: copy `templates/fleet/values.yaml` to
`environments/<env>/values.yaml` and fill in the fleet's id, its cell, and its
quota. That file existing is what makes the fleet real -- your control plane globs
for it -- and it gets the fleet a namespace, a quota and its hostnames.

Then copy `templates/workload/` to `environments/<env>/<app>/` and add one
dependency per application.

Your application's own repository holds its source and its Helm chart, builds it,
publishes that chart to a registry, and then commits the new version into the
`Chart.yaml` here. That commit is the deployment: your control plane reconciles
it on the next pass.

What lives here is a version and your values -- never an image digest, an overlay
or a rendered manifest. Two consequences are worth knowing. What you are running
is legible from this file without resolving anything, and a rollback is an edit to
one line, because the version you are going back to still exists in the registry.

Your build writes `Chart.yaml`; you write `values.yaml`. Same division as
`bundle.yaml` and `values.yaml` above, and for the same reason: two writers, no
shared field, nothing to arbitrate.

## Supplying an application's secrets

Three kinds of value reach a workload, and they are separated by **who owns the
value** rather than by how they are delivered.

**The platform generates what it owns.** A confidential OAuth client, a cache, a
database: you declare the CAPABILITY in your fleet's `values.yaml` and the
credentials are created and delivered for you. You never see them, and listing
their keys yourself claims to supply something you cannot produce.

**Git carries what is not secret.** Model names, bucket names, base URLs,
endpoint identifiers go in `config`. They are reviewed in the change that alters
them and readable without a credential. A model name should be a one-line commit,
not a credential rotation.

**You supply the rest.** Declare each one under `secrets` with the capability it
serves and the workloads that read it. Then, from the root of this repository:

```
soloz fleet secrets status <env>            what is declared, and what is present
soloz fleet secrets set <env> <KEY>         supply one value
```

`set` prompts with echo disabled, or takes `--stdin` so a password manager can
pipe into it. There is deliberately no flag that takes the value as an argument:
that puts it in your shell history and in the process table. There is no batch
form either, because a batch means a file and a file means secrets sitting on
your machine.

Rotation is `set` again. The value is replaced, the delivery mechanism sees the
change on its next refresh, and the workload restarts on it.

`status` prints key NAMES and never values, and is safe to paste into a ticket.
It also tells you what an absent secret actually costs: secrets are delivered one
object per workload, and that object is ATOMIC -- one key the provider cannot
supply fails all of them, so every container reading any key in it cannot start.
That is why the declaration names workloads, and why a non-secret does not belong
in `secrets`: a mistyped bucket name there withholds a credential from something
unrelated.

Your repository ships a script for the first-time case:

```
./scripts/seed-secrets.sh <env>              generate the file, or show what would be written
./scripts/seed-secrets.sh <env> --confirm    write it
```

Run with no `.env` present and it generates one holding exactly the keys your
fleet declares, with the capability each serves as its comment -- so there is no
list to transcribe and nothing to mistype. Fill in the values, run it again to
see what it would write, then add `--confirm`.

An entry you have not filled in is never written. It would otherwise replace a
secret that is already supplied with nothing, and the workload reading it would
start and fail -- so a half-filled file writes the half you filled and reports
the rest as empty.

The script is not a second way of doing this, and it does not decide which keys
are yours to supply. It is the first-time entrypoint, and it calls the same
commands you would otherwise run by hand:

```
./scripts/seed-secrets.sh dev --confirm
        │
        ├── soloz fleet secrets template dev   (only if .env is missing)
        └── soloz fleet secrets import dev --from-env environments/dev/.env --confirm
```

So there is one answer to "which keys does this fleet declare" and one place the
values are written, whichever you invoke. Use the script when you are supplying a
fleet's secrets for the first time. Use `soloz fleet secrets import` directly when
the values already exist in a file somewhere else and there is no skeleton to
generate -- migrating a fleet that predates this is exactly that case. Use
`soloz fleet secrets set` for one secret, or to rotate one.

You never type the tenant or the cell. Both are read from
`environments/<env>/values.yaml` -- `tenantId` and `cellId` -- and the storage
path is derived from them, so the place a value is written and the place the
workload reads it from cannot disagree. Naming that path by hand is how a secret
ends up under a cell the fleet does not run on, which surfaces later as a store
that appears broken rather than as the typo it was.

### How often you do this

Once per secret, for the life of the box -- not per application, and not per
rebuild.

A key is supplied once and delivered to every workload that declares it, so a
fleet's count is its number of distinct secrets and not its number of
applications: one shared token read by four workloads is one `set`.

**Rebuilding the cluster does not mean re-entering them.** Your secret store's
data is in the platform database, which backs up to object storage outside the
box, and the master keys that decrypt it are escrowed to an Infisical you control
and the platform does not. A rebuild restores the database and reads the same
master keys back from the escrow, so every secret is present and readable before
any workload starts. That is what the escrow is for: an escrow only one side can
reach is a backup with no restore.

So the realistic lifetime of a fleet with ten secrets is ten `set` calls -- or one
`import` if you are migrating -- then nothing until you rotate one or declare a
new capability. If you find yourself re-entering values after a rebuild, the
escrow or the database backup is broken, and that is the thing to fix rather than
a step to repeat.

### Migrating a fleet that predates this

If your values are currently in a `KEY=VALUE` file:

```
soloz fleet secrets import <env> --from-env <file>
```

It lists what it would write and writes nothing until you add `--confirm`, and it
writes **only keys your fleet declares** -- a seed file usually carries
configuration and connection settings alongside the secrets, and those belong in
`config` or nowhere. Delete the file afterwards: what remains is a second copy
that nothing rotates.

## Leaving

Revoke the platform's app installation. Proposals stop arriving; nothing stops
running. Everything here is already yours.
