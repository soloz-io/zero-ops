# Supply an application's secrets from a local .env file, by KEY=VALUE.

#   ./scripts/seed-secrets.sh <app> <environment> [--confirm]
#
# THE FILES
#
#   environments/<env>/<app>/.env.example   committed: every key this app
#                                           declares, empty, with the capability
#                                           each serves. No values, ever.
#   environments/<env>/<app>/.env           yours: a copy of the example with
#                                           the values filled in. Gitignored.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#
#   1. Checks .env.example still lists exactly what the app declares. If the
#      declaration changed, it stops and says how to regenerate the example.
#   2. Without .env, copies .env.example to .env (mode 600) and stops, so you
#      can fill it in.
#   3. Shows which keys would be written, and writes nothing.
#   4. With --confirm, writes them.
#
# An entry left empty is never written: it would replace a supplied secret
# with nothing. Re-running with a new value for a key rotates it. For one key,
# `soloz fleet secrets set <env> <app> <KEY>` prompts with echo disabled and
# touches no file at all.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
#
# Feed the whole file. Only keys declared under `secrets:` in
# environments/<env>/<app>/values.yaml are written; configuration belongs in
# `config:` there, in git, where it can be reviewed.
#
# The filtering and the example's content are not implemented here. Both come
# from `soloz fleet secrets`, the same command `status` and `set` use, so there
# is ONE answer to "which keys does this app declare" -- a second
# implementation in a script is a second answer, and the two disagree the
# moment either changes.
