The globals every platform-owned component receives.

One definition, because nine hand-written copies is how a component ends up
without one. hubDomain was added to two of them and missed in the rest, so the
HubEnvironment -- the object ADR-051 makes the authority for the base domain --
rendered spec.domain empty and the API server rejected it: "spec.domain in body
should match ...". Six boundaries had already deployed.

Extra globals are ignored by a chart that does not read them, so passing the
same set everywhere costs nothing and removes the question of which component
needs which.

Takes the root context.

The same globals, with `provider` resolved to the ADR-046 §11 placement class.

For the three stateful components the variant selector must follow where the

then files/<env> then files/<provider>, and a hybrid box placing its data on-prem
would otherwise render the cloud overlay and pin a storage class its nodes cannot
provision (ADR-075).

Those elements used to emit globalValues and then restate `provider:` under the
same `global:` mapping. It produced the right answer only because YAML takes the
last of a duplicated key -- a correctness that depended on emission order, in a
document nothing parsed strictly. One emitter, so the override cannot be undone
by moving a line.
